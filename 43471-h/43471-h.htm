<p>There is such a profusion of good books in this list, that it is an
impossibility to urge you to select any particular title or author's
work. All that we can say is that any line that contains the complete
works of Mrs. Georgie Sheldon, Charles Garvice, Mrs. Harriet
Lewis, May Agnes Fleming, Wenona Gilman, Mrs. Alex. McVeigh
Miller, and other writers of the same type, is worthy of your attention,
especially when the price has been set at 15 cents the volume.</p>

<h3>A WEB OF FATE.</h3>


<p>"I would sell my soul to Satan for a chest of gold!"
cried a despairing voice.</p>

<p>It was a young girl who uttered the words. She was
standing under a tree in Central Park, watching the
equipages that rolled past in a constant stream. A handsome
victoria, in which sat a golden-haired beauty, one
of the famed Four Hundred of New York, had just
whirled past, and the dust from the wheels had blown
into the speaker's face, drawing those reckless words
from her lips:</p>

<p>"I would sell my soul to Satan for a chest of gold!"</p>

<p>Of a truth, the girl was fair enough to have exchanged
places with the regal woman in the carriage,
for her face and form had been shaped in beauty's fairest
mold, though the cheek was wan and pale from the pangs
of grief and hunger, and the peerless form was draped
in worn and shabby garments.</p>

<p>But the fires of pride and ambition burned brightly in
the large Spanish-looking dark eyes, as the girl clasped
her small ungloved hands together.</p>

<p>"Would you marry me?" asked a low, sneering voice
in her ear.</p>

<p>She turned with a start of terror, and it appeared to
her as if her reckless words had summoned the arch-fiend
himself to her side.</p>

<p>The person who had addressed her was a horribly ugly
and grotesque-looking old man.</p>

<p>He was at least sixty-five years of age, bent and stoop-shouldered,
with features that were homely to the point
of grotesqueness. His nose was large, his mouth wide,
his small malevolent gray eyes peered beneath bushy red
eyebrows supplemented by grizzled hair and whiskers of
the same lurid color. His clothing was scrupulously neat,
but well-worn and of cheap material.</p>

<p>"Would you marry me?" repeated this old man, and
the beautiful girl gave a start of surprise not unmixed
with fear.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;why, you are as poor as I am!" she
gasped, her eyes roving over his shabby attire.</p>

<p>"Appearances are often deceitful, young lady. I look
like a beggar, I know, and, truth to tell, I live like one,
but I am rich enough to give you your heart's desire&mdash;a
chest of gold. Did you ever hear of Charles Farnham,
the miser?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I am Farnham, the miser, young lady, and for once
I have a generous impulse. You are young, beautiful,
and poor. I am old, ugly, and rich. In the world of
fashion such marriages are not uncommon. Will you
marry me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>She gazed into his repulsive features, and shuddered.</p>

<p>"No, no, no!"</p>

<p>"You are very independent," he sneered. "What is
your name? Where do you live?"</p>

<p>"My name is no concern of yours. My home will soon
be&mdash;in&mdash;the&mdash;river!"</p>

<p>"What mean you, girl?"</p>

<p>"What I have just told you, sir. I am a poor and
honest girl, out of work, penniless, and friendless, turned
into the streets to-day to starve. Before nightfall I shall
end my sorrows in the river."</p>

<p>"A girl with that beautiful face and form need never
starve," returned the old miser, with a significant leer.</p>

<p>The pale, young face flushed to a burning crimson,
and the large, dark eyes flashed angrily.</p>

<p>"I have been told that many times, sir, but I am an
honest girl. I can die, but I cannot do wrong."</p>

<p>"It is too beautiful a day to die," returned the old
miser, looking around him at the green grass and flowers
and golden sunshine.</p>

<p>The park was crowded. There were throngs on foot,
throngs in carriages. Beautiful women were plenty, but
none of them could compare with the young girl standing
there in the dust of their carriage-wheels talking to the
old miser.</p>

<p>"Look at those handsome creatures in their magnificent
carriages with liveried servants&mdash;look at their silks and
jewels. Do you not envy them?" demanded Farnham.
"You are more beautiful than they are. It is very foolish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
of you to drown yourself for lack of bread when I offer
you wealth and splendor as my wife."</p>

<p>"But I could not love you. You are old&mdash;hideous&mdash;and
I could not marry any one I did not love; I would
rather die."</p>

<p>A fierce gleam came into the old man's eyes.</p>

<p>"You are the proudest pauper I ever saw, yet your
very scorn makes you seem more desirable in my eyes,"
he exclaimed. "Come, give your consent to marry me,
and you shall have one of the finest homes in New York&mdash;carriages,
jewels, Paris dresses, opera-boxes, and an
adoring husband. Would you not like all this?"</p>

<p>"All but the husband!" answered the girl frankly and
sadly. "Oh, forgive me, sir, but your wealth would not
make me happy if I had to live by your side."</p>

<p>"Yet you said just now that you would sell your soul
to Satan for a chest of gold."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I spoke thoughtlessly, sir. I did not think that
Satan would hear me," she murmured in an undertone.</p>

<p>The miser saw in her eyes a girlish scorn that maddened
him; yet, strange to say, it made him more eager
to possess this luring though scornful beauty. He stood
gazing covetously at her, and suddenly she added archly:</p>

<p>"I have read stories about people who sold themselves
to the devil; but you see they had a little respite first,
and rather enjoyed life before he claimed them, but if I
married you I should be signed, sealed, and delivered
over at once to the enemy," and she laughed, a mocking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
mirthless laugh, for, in truth, she was desperate with
despair and misery.</p>

<p>"You are very complimentary," said her strange suitor,
with a contortion of the lip that was a cross between a
grin and a sneer. He had an angry longing to strike
the beautiful face that looked at him with such defiant
scorn, for the girl was as proud as she was poor, and she
had her treasured love-dreams like all other young girls&mdash;dreams
of a rich and handsome lover who might some
day woo her for his bride.</p>

<p>Miser Farnham, with a frightful grimace, withdrew
from her side, but remained close by, watching the lonely,
desolate creature with keen, calculating gray eyes.</p>

<p>Something more than an hour went by, and as the
brilliant pageant of wealth and fashion began to fade,
the girl drew a long, shuddering sigh, and turned to
leave the park. A jibing voice sounded in her ear:</p>

<p>"Are you going to the river now?"</p>

<p>The dark eyes, heavy now with despair, turned upon
the face of the old man.</p>

<p>"Yes; I am going to the river," she replied, in a dull,
dreary tone.</p>

<p>"Will you wait one moment, please?"</p>

<p>She stopped and looked at him in dull wonder, her face
so pallid, her eyes so despairing, that he shuddered to
meet them.</p>

<p>"You said just now that Satan always gave a respite
to those whose souls he bought; I have pondered deeply
over those words, and here is the result: I will give you
a respite, if you will marry me. No, don't turn away so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
recklessly. I mean it, young lady. Marry me to-day,
and I will not see you again for a whole year. In the
meantime you shall reign a queen in a palace; your life
shall be a dream of delight. In my hand is the wand of
the magician&mdash;gold&mdash;yellow gold&mdash;and I can accomplish
all that I promise, and more! Think! A whole year of
luxury, of pleasure, and in that time not one sight of my
face. Can you turn from this to the dark, cold river?
Surely, then, you must be mad!"</p>

<p>The girl stood like one rooted to the spot, her eyes
dark, burning, eager. What was it he was offering?
Wealth, ease, happiness&mdash;and she was homeless and
starving. Her brain reeled; she trembled with excitement.</p>

<p>"A year," repeated old Farnham temptingly, "and in
all that time I will not come near you. Only speak the
word, and we will go now to a lawyer, I will have a marriage
contract drawn, waiving all rights for one year
from the date of marriage. Then we will be married. I
will secure a chaperon and maid for you, and, leaving
you in a home of luxury, take my departure until the
months of your respite are over. Perhaps by then your
gratitude to me will lead you to look on me with favor&mdash;if
not, there is still the river"&mdash;leering wickedly.</p>

<p>Surely a stranger offer had never been made to a fair
and homeless girl. It was romantic in some of its
aspects, and it was tempting to the forlorn young creature.
A gleam of piteous hope came into the large, sad
eyes. A year or more of life, of ease, of comfort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"No poor girl ever had such a chance before. Surely,
you consent," continued the wily tempter.</p>

<p>"Yes, I consent," answered the girl, with stiff lips and
unsmiling eyes.</p>

<p>"Good," uttered the miser, with a chuckle of satisfaction.
He caught her small ungloved hand and pressed it
with awkward gallantry. It was cold as a lump of ice,
and fell stiffly from his clasp. Then she looked at him
and spoke again, briefly and coldly:</p>

<p>"I am trusting fully in your promises," she said. "Remember,
you must not play me false, or weak girl as I
am, I shall know how to punish you."</p>

<p>"You can trust me, for I love you," he answered, in
wheedling tones. "Come now, let us go at once to a
lawyer. We can get a cab at the park gates."</p>

<p>She followed him away from the park, and when
seated in the cab on their way to the lawyer's, he said:</p>

<p>"When the contract is drawn up, and we are married,
the first thing will be to get you some clothing and jewels
suitable for a beautiful young heiress. The next thing
will be a chaperon. Well, I know an aristocratic woman,
widowed and reduced to poverty, who will gladly take
charge of you for the splendid salary and privileges she
will get. She has one daughter, who will be a fitting
companion for you. These two will make it possible for
you to enter at once into the best society. You will be
introduced to them as my ward, not as my wife. Then,
with your chest of gold, you will enter upon a dazzling
career. Your wealth and your beauty, and the prestige
your chaperon will confer upon you, will enable you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
dazzle the world of society and fashion. Does the picture
please you?"</p>

<p>"I must be dreaming," answered the girl, passing her
hand across her eyes in a bewildered fashion.</p>

<p>But the rest of the day seemed but a continuation of
her dream. They went at once to a lawyer, who drew
up the strange marriage-contract; then to a minister,
who united them in matrimonial bonds. Next the old
miser took his bride to a large store, where he gave
orders that she should be supplied with an outfit of clothing
suitable to her needs as a young heiress. Obsequious
clerks flew to do his bidding; then, drawing her aside,
he said:</p>

<p>"I shall leave you here several hours while I go to see
the lady who will be your chaperon during the one year
that you will pass as my rich ward instead of my wife."</p>

<p>He paused a moment, then added, with an air of hesitancy:</p>

<p>"I have decided that your home shall be for the first
few weeks at a seaside residence I own in New Jersey.
I will arrange for you to go this evening, as it is but a
short distance from New York. Be all ready in your
traveling-dress when I call for you with the lady and
your maid at six o'clock."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<h3>AT PIRATE BEACH.</h3>


<p>It was midnight, and the moon rode high in the star-spangled
sky, and mirrored itself in the ocean as it rolled
its long and heavy swells in upon the silvery sands of the
shell-strewn shore.</p>

<p>Far up the beach stood an old, graystone mansion,
many-gabled and picturesque, surrounded by handsome
and spacious grounds dotted with trees and shrubberies.
Up in the second story a dim light gleamed from an open
casement, and from it leaned a girl watching the beauty
of the summer night with dark, solemn eyes&mdash;Nita Farnham,
the miser's bride.</p>

<p>Charles Farnham, Mrs. Courtney, the chaperon; a
maid, and several servants had accompanied Nita here.
The old man had stayed only one hour, at the end of
which he had accompanied his bride to her chamber and
showed her upon the hearth-rug a small iron-bound box
containing the promised gold.</p>

<p>"The little chest is yours, all yours," he said, with a
strange emphasis. "There are many thousands of dollars
in it, but they are nothing to my great wealth. I am
many times a millionaire. Ah, Farnham, the miser,
eking out his wretched life by selling cigars on the elevated
railroad, but they little dream of his stores of hidden
wealth. Wait one year more, and they will stare in
envy at my Fifth Avenue palace and my peerless bride!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>She shuddered uncontrollably, and, dropping the cold
hand he had taken in farewell, he turned away with a
grin.</p>

<p>"Good-by, for a year, my beauty!"</p>

<p>She bowed in horror; then locked the door, and stood
alone in the luxurious chamber, with the shadow of a
fateful tragedy looming over her unconscious head and
the price for which she had sold herself&mdash;the chest of
gold&mdash;lying open at her feet.</p>

<p>The maid tapped presently upon the door, but Nita
sent her away.</p>

<p>"I shall not need you to-night. You may retire."</p>

<p>But sleep was far from Nita's eyes. Midnight found
her leaning from her window, watching the moonlight on
the sea and the gray mist creeping up the shore, and
murmuring over and over:</p>

<p>"Pirate's Beach! Pirate's Beach! How strange that
he should have brought me here! Here of all places in
the wide, wide world!"</p>

<p>A strange, beguiling melancholy crept over her as she
listened to the voice of the sea as the surf broke continuously
upon the beach. The very beauty of the summer
night oppressed her.</p>

<p>"I am married, married," she murmured sadly. "I
should not mind it if my husband were young and handsome,
and we loved each other; but, alas, I am forever
cut off from love's sweetness&mdash;I am bound by golden
chains to that hideous old miser."</p>

<p>Nita was passionate, wilful, and undisciplined. A
strange life had been hers, and it had left her like some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
beautiful, untamed, wild bird&mdash;untrammeled by conventionalities.
The great, inrolling waves down on the
beach seemed crying out to her yearningly:</p>

<p>"Come, come, come. We love you, we understand
you!"</p>

<p>She flung a thick woolen shawl over her dark head,
and stole down to the beach, and stood there dreamily,
her gray-clad form blending softly with the creeping gray
mist.</p>

<p>"How familiar it all looks, yet that old man did not
dream I had ever been here before. I wonder if old Meg,
the fortune-teller, lives here still? What if we meet?
What if she recognizes me?"</p>

<p>She ran with a light, quick step along the beach for
about half a mile, then paused pantingly close to a tumble-down
old shanty that had evidently been constructed
out of the black hull of an ancient wreck. From a tiny,
smoke-begrimed window a dim light pierced through the
murky sea fog, and Nita murmured:</p>

<p>"So she is here still, the old harpy!"</p>

<p>She bent her head, and peered through the dim little
panes into the shanty. A smothered cry escaped her
lips.</p>

<p>"Good heavens! what is that old man doing here?"</p>

<p>Seated by a table, ornamented with bottles and pipes,
Nita had seen an ugly, witchlike old crone in close converse
with&mdash;Farnham, the miser. It flashed into her
mind that he was seeking from old Meg some knowledge
of the future which she pretended to foretell, and she
smiled in ironical amusement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"An old man like that ought to know that Meg's pretentions
are all humbug," she thought impatiently, and
bent her ear to listen to their words. Old Meg was muttering
with fierce gesticulations:</p>

<p>"I don't understand your plans nor approve them. Beware
how you trifle with me, Farnham, or I will tear her
from that stately home. I will make her my slave as in
the old days before she ran away from my boy's love,
the proud jade!"</p>

<p>Miser Farnham put out a lean hand and gripped the
virago's wrist so tightly that she screamed with pain.</p>

<p>"Behave yourself then, you she-devil, and do not presume
to question my actions. You will leave the girl
alone, remember. She belongs to me now, for I found
her after you had let her escape your clutches. No wonder
she fled from you. The bare idea of that ruffianly
son of yours aspiring to the hand of the proud Juan de
Castro's daughter&mdash;faugh!"</p>

<p>"You know what he wanted," Meg growled significantly.</p>

<p>"Yes, what he will never get," was the harsh reply,
and Farnham only laughed at her incoherent ravings.
To Nita it seemed plain that the fiendish pair shared
some dark secret between them, and that the man held
the balance of power.</p>

<p>"They are plotting against me. They both know the
secret of my parentage, although old Meg has told me a
hundred times that I was cast up by the sea. What if
I go in there and tax them with their villainy, and demand
the truth?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>With flashing dark eyes she moved toward the door,
and her hand touched the knob to throw it open. A moment's
indecision, then her brave heart failed her. She
recoiled, shuddering with a sudden fear.</p>

<p>"No, no, I dare not. They might murder me," and
she hurried from the spot, with terror-winged feet.</p>

<p>When the old black hulk and its glimmering light
were swallowed up in the gloom, Nita stopped a moment
to take breath, and turned her exquisite white face toward
the sea.</p>

<p>"Oh, ocean, how I love you, you great murmuring
mystery!" she cried, stretching out her white hands lovingly,
as the surf rolled in.</p>

<p>Hark, what was that blending with the hollow voice
of the waves? A human voice, a deep groan as of one
dying! Nita uttered a cry of superstitious terror, and
ran wildly a few paces farther along the shore. A broken
shell pierced the sole of her thin shoe, but she limped
painfully on, half-blinded by the salt spray and her own
startling tears, when suddenly she stumbled over a body
lying directly in her path, and fell prostrate.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<h3>"IT IS BETTER THAT YOU DIE."</h3>


<p>Nita believed for a moment that she had stumbled over
a body cast up by the cruel sea. That strange awe of
death overcame her at first, and, struggling painfully
to her feet, she was about to hurry from the spot when
she was suddenly arrested by a low moan similar to the
one that had so startled her when she was several paces
away.</p>

<p>She realized that it was not a corpse, it was a living
being, lying unconscious at her feet&mdash;a living being, wet
already with the surf, that went over him each time it
rolled in on the shore. The tide was coming in strongly,
and presently the fatal undertow would sweep him out
to sea.</p>

<p>"It must not be!" she cried.</p>

<p>Sinking down on her knees, she gazed into the white,
upturned face for some sign of life.</p>

<p>"Oh, pitiful Heaven, he is dead!" cried Nita wildly,
and she laid her white hand with an involuntary, tender
caress on the broad, white brow, from which the wet
masses of brown curls fell carelessly back.</p>

<p>Did her touch recall him to life? The broad breast
heaved suddenly, the eyelids fluttered open, and the
young girl met the wondering gaze of a pair of eyes that
seemed to pierce her heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>The next moment a giant wave rolled in and flung
her prostrate against his breast. Drenched and shivering,
Nita struggled to her knees again.</p>

<p>"You are alive, thank Heaven," she exclaimed gladly.
"Oh, speak to me, sir; let me help you to rise, for if we
remain here, the sea will sweep us both away."</p>

<p>She had to bend her ear close to his lips to catch the
faint reply:</p>

<p>"I am&mdash;wounded&mdash;and have no&mdash;strength&mdash;to rise.
Go&mdash;save yourself&mdash;leave me&mdash;to&mdash;my&mdash;fate!"</p>

<p>It must have cost him a severe effort to utter the disjointed
words, for with the last one his eyes closed and
he became unconscious.</p>

<p>And out upon the ocean Nita saw the white-caps rolling
in to the shore, as if eager to seize and carry off
their helpless victim. From her pallid lips came a cry
of despair, and, seizing his shoulders, she tried to drag
him further up the beach.</p>

<p>"God help me to save him," she prayed aloud, for the
heavy body resisted her efforts, and she was distinctly
conscious of as strong a yearning to save this man's life
as though he had been a beloved friend of long, long
years.</p>

<p>A happy thought came to her, and, dragging the
strong woolen shawl from her head, she passed it with
difficulty under his body, knotting the long ends on his
breast. Just then another strong wave engulfed them.
Clinging to the end of the shawl, she bent down and let
it rush and roar above them, with its thunder of sound,
and almost resistless fury of force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>With her whole heart uplifted in prayer, Nita grasped
the ends of the shawl, and slowly, wearily, but determinedly,
dragged the heavy form of her companion far
up the beach; and within the gates of her home, where
she sank down, exhausted, and gazed anxiously into
his unconscious face, her heart convulsed by an agonizing
yearning that he might live.</p>

<p>But the features remained still and lifeless, the broad
breast did not heave with the faintest sign of life. She
noted even then with the eyes of an artist his wonderful
beauty.</p>

<p>"Oh, the pity of it that one so beautiful should die like
this," she sobbed, and laid her hand caressingly upon his
brow. Then she started as from a trance, and withdrew
her hand from his brow, sobbing under her breath:
"It is better that you died, for if you had lived you would
have lured my heart away!"</p>

<p>She shivered as the keen breeze swept over her
drenched form, bearing with it the intoxicating scent of
June flowers blooming riotously in the neglected gardens,
and rising wearily, she toiled up to the house and
aroused the servants.</p>

<p>They gazed at her in amazement when she briefly explained
the situation, and commanded them to bring the
unconscious man into the house, and send for a doctor.</p>

<p>When the man-servant and the housekeeper had
brought the dripping form and laid it on a bed, the woman
cried out in wonder:</p>

<p>"What a strange thing! Why, I know this young
man, Miss Farnham! He is Mr. Dorian Mountcastle."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>And the pale young creature, leaning over the pillow,
looked at her with dark, eager eyes, and murmured:</p>

<p>"Is he dead? Do you think that he is dead?"</p>

<p>"The Lord knows, honey; he looks like it, that's certain.
But we can tell better when the doctor comes.
Now do you go right up to your room, please, and get
some dry clothes on before you catch your death of cold,
while we tend to the young man," pushing her gently
toward the door.</p>

<p>Nita threw one long look of mute despair upon Dorian
Mountcastle's still and beautiful face, with the long,
dark lashes lying so heavily upon the death-white cheeks,
and moved silently out of the room, dragging herself
wearily up the stairs, encumbered by her dripping wet
garments, that left little rills of salt-water wherever she
moved.</p>

<p>As she went along the dim corridor to her room her
lips moved ever so slightly. She was whispering:</p>

<p>"Dorian! Dorian! What a soft, sweet name!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Nita had left her room, obeying the strange impulse
that had tempted her out to the shore in the dead
hour of the night, she had forgotten the open chest of
gold upon the floor; she had even left the door standing
slightly ajar with a dim light burning on the dainty
dressing-table.</p>

<p>It was just the same now as she stepped across the
threshold, little pools of salt-water sinking into the rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
carpet. She stopped then, staring before her in wild-eyed
horror.</p>

<p>Upon the rug crouched the haglike woman she had
seen but a little while ago, cursing Miser Farnham in
the old shanty. Her back was turned to Nita, her clawlike,
skinny hands were diving into the chest of gold.
She was filling her apron with the glittering coins. She
had not heard the light footstep behind her, but suddenly
a sharp voice rang in her ear:</p>

<p>"Put back that gold, you vile thief! What are you
doing here?"</p>

<p>The old woman started so violently that the corners
of her apron fell, and the gold pieces rolled in every direction.
Springing wildly to her feet, she confronted
Nita with the horrible, burning eyes of a murderess.</p>

<p>"I came here to kill you, Juanita de Castro, and to
avenge my son!" she hissed, springing on her victim like a
tigress.</p>

<p>Ere Nita could cry for help, she was borne down by
her enemy's fierce onslaught, her white throat gripped in
a clutch of death.</p>

<h3>LIZETTE SAVES HER MISTRESS.</h3>


<p>When Nita had left the room the housekeeper stood
gazing with deep commiseration at the deathlike face of
Dorian Mountcastle as it lay among the pillows.</p>

<p>"Not much use to send for a doctor, for he is certainly
dead, poor fellow," she said aloud.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a pity!" exclaimed a voice at her side, and,
turning abruptly, she saw a pretty young woman&mdash;Nita's
maid, Lizette.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Hill, I hope he's not dead! Can I do anything
to help you, please?"</p>

<p>"Why, Lizette, I did not know you were out of your
bed, but I'm glad some one awoke you, for your mistress
needs you very badly. Go up-stairs and attend to
her while I wait here for the doctor."</p>

<p>Lizette went away obediently, and ascended the stairs
to Nita's room, full of surprise at the strange happenings
of this summer night at Pirate Beach.</p>

<p>Finding Nita's door ajar, she stepped over the threshold.
Then she recoiled with a cry of surprise and terror.</p>

<p>A startling sight was before her eyes. Prostrate upon
the floor lay her young mistress, and across her body was
stretched the lean, lithe frame of an old witchlike woman,
whose skinny claws gripped Nita's throat in a murderous
clasp. The victim's face was purple and distorted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>The dim light that shone upon the scene showed also
to the wondering maid the open chest of gold and the
glittering coins scattered over the floor in reckless profusion,
where the hag had dropped them in her spring
upon Nita.</p>

<p>One moment's recoil of amazement and horror, then
Lizette comprehended the full meaning of the scene&mdash;robbery
and murder.</p>

<p>"Lord help me!" she exclaimed, and sprang upon the
murderess, grasping her arms in a viselike hold, and
tearing them apart from Nita's throat, although the hag
struggled and snarled like a wild beast baffled of its prey.</p>

<p>Finding herself unable to regain her grip on the girl,
she turned with a fierce howl upon her assailant. There
was murder in Meg's heart, and she was determined to
silence forever the witness to her attempt upon Nita's
life.</p>

<p>But although she was strong and wiry, her lean frame
soon weakened under the vigorous onslaught of her
young and agile foe, and the struggle soon ended, for
Lizette adroitly tripped her up, and she fell heavily, her
head striking the corner of the iron-bound chest with a
loud thud.</p>

<p>Then the maid turned to kneel down by her unconscious
mistress. Nita lay motionless, but when Lizette
put her ear against the girl's heart she was rejoiced to
find that it was still throbbing faintly.</p>

<p>"Poor darling, that old fiend didn't quite kill her!" she
cried joyfully, and set to work to revive her hapless mistress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>But Nita came back to life very slowly, and it was
not until her wet garments were all removed and she
was laid in her bed, that she opened a pair of languid
dark eyes and met the affectionate gaze of the anxious
maid.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" she breathed faintly, and Lizette
explained, softening the whole affair as much as she
could, not to excite the patient.</p>

<p>"You saved my life, Lizette," cried Nita gratefully.
Then she shuddered at perceiving the unconscious form of
the old fortune-teller.</p>

<p>"I'll see how much she's hurt now; I have been tending
to you all this time," said the maid. "I don't suppose
she's dead, but there's an awful cut on the side of her
head. She will go to prison for this if she lives&mdash;oh,
Lordy!" as the apparently dead woman suddenly opened
her dazed eyes and lifted up her grizzled head. Lizette
sprang to the door, and locked it.</p>

<p>"You don't get out of here except to go to prison,
old woman," she observed, then brought water and
sponges and bathed and bandaged the wounded head.
Then she gave Meg a drink of cordial, and said:</p>

<p>"You're all right now. The cut ain't as bad as I
thought at first. Well, now I'm going to send for an officer
and hand you over on a charge of attempted robbery
and murder."</p>

<p>The hag sprang to her feet, her sullen face ghastly
in the dim light, her eyes lurid with hate.</p>

<p>"You shall not send me to prison," she hissed savagely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will see!" cried the maid, stretching out her
hand to the bell.</p>

<p>Meg's skinny, upraised arm arrested the movement.</p>

<p>"Wait. See what your mistress will say," she snarled,
and, moving to the side of the bed, she bent down and
whispered sharply for several minutes in Nita's ear.</p>

<p>A low cry of horror came from the bed, and the old
harpy moved aside, muttering significantly:</p>

<p>"I knew when I told you that, you would let me go
free. Indeed, I did not mean to touch you if I could get
the gold without&mdash;but you took me by surprise."</p>

<p>Lizette looked at her mistress for orders.</p>

<p>"Miss Nita, you surely won't let the old hag escape?"
she cried.</p>

<p>"Yes, open the door," Nita cried faintly, shudderingly.</p>

<p>"But, Miss Nita&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let the woman go!" Nita repeated, and the maid reluctantly
obeyed. Then Nita said faintly:</p>

<p>"Lizette, I am already your debtor for my life, and indeed
you will find me grateful. Do me one more kindness.
Keep the secret of this terrible adventure locked
forever in your breast unless I give you leave to speak."</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Nita, is it best to shield that old wretch
from justice? She may come back again and carry off
all your gold, and kill you, too."</p>

<p>"No, Lizette, she has sworn never to attempt it again,
and you must keep it a secret. Gather up the gold, put
it back in the chest, and lock it carefully away. But
first take some for yourself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Nita, I don't want any reward for saving
your life."</p>

<p>"But I insist," murmured Nita sweetly. "Take five
hundred dollars."</p>

<p>She saw the young woman's eyes grow suddenly eager.</p>

<p>"God bless you, Miss Nita. It means so much to me&mdash;oh,
you can't think the good I can do with just two
hundred dollars. I will take that much, no more, if you
please, and, dear Miss Nita, I'll love you with every drop
of my heart's blood to the end of my life for this. Oh,
I will tell you all some day, my lady," and Lizette, sobbing
like a little child, kissed Nita's white hand. Then
she locked and carefully put away the chest of gold.</p>

<p>"For no one else must find out that you have such a
treasure in this room," she said cautiously.</p>

<p>Then Nita sighed wearily:</p>

<p>"Oh, Lizette, I feel so tired and ill. My arms ache
with pain, my whole body is stiff and sore. I should like
to go to sleep, but first you must go down-stairs and
bring me news of Dorian Mountcastle&mdash;if he is dead or
alive, for surely the doctor must have come by this
time."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<h3>A PLOT TO WIN A LOVER.</h3>


<p>Mrs. Courtney, sitting at a desk in her own room the
morning after the arrival at Pirate Beach, was busy
writing a letter to her daughter, who had been absent
from New York when Miser Farnham had called at her
lodgings and electrified her with the welcome offer to
become the chaperon of his beautiful ward.</p>

<p>After acquainting her daughter with these facts and
the later ones of the night's happenings, Mrs. Courtney
added:</p>

<p>"Now, prepare for a joyful surprise, my dear Azalea.
A happy fate has thrown Dorian Mountcastle across
your path again. It is he whom Miss Farnham so romantically
saved, and although he has a mysterious
wound in the side which will cause several weeks of
confinement, the doctor thinks he can pull him safely
through. Of course, I shall nurse him assiduously, and
I want you to drop everything and come home. That
girl is quite ill to-day, feverish and delirious from her
exposure last night. Before she is well enough to come
down and see Dorian Mountcastle, you will have a chance
to cut her out with him. Our former acquaintance will
be to your advantage, too, for there is some secrecy
about Miss Farnham's antecedents that I don't at all approve.
Well, if you can only secure the prize, we can
soon drop this other affair; so come quickly, my dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
daughter, for I know your heart seconds my wishes in
this matter."</p>

<p>It was barely twenty-four hours later that Nita's maid
said to her mistress, who was still too ill to leave her
bed:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Courtney's daughter, Miss Azalea, came to-day."</p>

<p>"Is she pretty?" asked Nita&mdash;always a girl's first question
about another one.</p>

<p>"She is a little thing with blue eyes, rosy cheeks, and
golden hair. The housekeeper was just telling me that
these Courtneys used to be grand rich people, and that
they are old friends of this Mr. Dorian Mountcastle."</p>

<p>"Old friends," murmured the invalid, and her heart
gave an inexplicable throb of pain.</p>

<p>"And," continued Lizette, "Mrs. Hill says Mrs. Courtney
is perfectly devoted to the young man, and just takes
the nursing right out of her hands."</p>

<p>Nita smiled a little contemptuously, for Mrs. Courtney
had made her but two formal visits, into both of
which she had infused a sarcastic disapproval of the
girl's nocturnal wandering.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Courtney, it was an irresistible impulse
stronger than myself that led me out. Indeed, I think
God sent me to save Mr. Mountcastle's life," the girl
had cried reverently.</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney had smiled in a sort of cold derision.</p>

<p>"Never go out alone like that again. I would never
forgive my daughter, Azalea, for doing anything so
highly improper," she had replied stiffly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>And now Azalea had arrived upon the scene, and the
housekeeper had bluntly told Lizette that the lady was
preparing to throw her pretty daughter at the young
man's head.</p>

<p>"But it won't work, for he's always talking about Miss
Farnham, and begging to see her to thank her for her
bravery. He told me he took her for a real angel when
he first opened his eyes down there by the water and saw
her face!" cried Mrs. Hill, and Lizette returned:</p>

<p>"And when Miss Nita was delirious last night, she
kept calling his name: 'Dorian, Dorian, Dorian,' like
they were old acquaintances. I think myself, it's a case
of love at first sight on both sides."</p>

<p>"And so do I, Lizette."</p>

<p>And, kindly, romantic souls that they were, they took
a keen, womanly delight in this incipient love-affair. Miss
Farnham had saved Mr. Mountcastle's life, and in novel-lore
this romantic incident always led up to love and
marriage.</p>

<p>It was noon the next day before Nita saw Azalea. A
bewitching golden-haired vision in a white morning-gown,
with floating blue ribbons, that matched the color
of her large, turquoise-blue eyes, and brought out clearly
the rose-pink tinting of her soft skin&mdash;this was the fairy
that floated into Nita's room alone, and murmured gushingly:</p>

<p>"How do you do, Miss Farnham? Mama has been
trying to keep me out, saying that you were too ill to be
disturbed. But you must not mind me, will you? I am
only Azalea! May I call you Nita?" Dropping suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
on her knees, she kissed Nita's feverish cheek. "I
love you, you brave heroine!" she cried.</p>

<p>Nita could only smile, for Azalea gave her no chance
to speak. She went on cooingly:</p>

<p>"I want to whisper a sweet secret to you, dear. I love
you already, because&mdash;well, because you saved Dorian's
life. When I came yesterday and found him here, I almost
fainted with surprise and joy. Do you understand,
Nita? Dorian and I were&mdash;lovers&mdash;once&mdash;but afterward
we were cruelly parted. But now, we have made
it up, and are happy. But only think, dearest, if you
had not saved his life that night I should have gone
mourning him all my days. God bless you, Nita."</p>

<p>Strange that those words of blessing almost sounded
like a curse in Nita's ears. She shrank from the red
lips that again caressed her cheek, and murmured coldly:</p>

<p>"Pray, take a seat, Miss Courtney."</p>

<p>"Do I weary you, poor dear?" sinking gracefully into
an arm-chair. "Oh, how dreadfully ill you look; I suppose
you will be in bed for weeks."</p>

<p>"I am going to sit up to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Surely not so soon, dear. I don't think mama will
permit you."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, I shall not ask her leave, Lizette
is my nurse"&mdash;quietly.</p>

<p>"But I thought mama ought to be consulted. She is
your chaperon, you know"&mdash;wheedingly.</p>

<p>"I am very wilful, Miss Courtney, and intend to have
my own way. I am better, and there is no need of my
remaining in bed longer than to-morrow. Then, too, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
have a guest, you should remember, and courtesy demands
that I should greet him as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"Although a perfect stranger to you. But, perhaps,
mama will not consider it correct form for you to visit
the invalid," almost sneered Azalea.</p>

<p>"You have called on him, I presume"&mdash;pointedly.</p>

<p>"Why, of course"&mdash;flushing slightly&mdash;"but that is very
different. I have known Dorian a long time."</p>

<p>"Ah, and I saved his life," replied Nita quietly.</p>

<p>Their glances met, the artful blue ones, the defiant
black ones&mdash;in their hearts they knew themselves sworn
foes. Nita saw through the girl before her, her artfulness,
her assumptions, and despised her already.</p>

<p>"Can it be true that Dorian Mountcastle loves this
pretty, shallow girl?" she wondered, with inexplicable
anger and bitterness. She thought him a thousand times
too good and noble for Azalea, and felt a sudden passionate
longing to be free of the hated fetters that held
her in thrall that she might measure lances with her for
the prize of his heart.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<h3>UNDER THE ROOF OF GRAY GABLES.</h3>


<p>Dorian Mountcastle belonged to that gay, careless,
half-Bohemian class of rich young men, who, without
seriously offending the proprieties, manage to set at
naught many of the petty conventionalities that obtain
in their set, and enjoy themselves after their own fashion
in a sort of come-and-go-as-you-please style.</p>

<p>He was five-and-twenty. His parents had both died
before he was sixteen, and he had traveled extensively,
five years with a tutor, and latterly alone. Many men
envied him, and many women sighed for him&mdash;or for
his fortune, he was not certain which.</p>

<p>Chance had brought the young man to Pirate Beach
the night of Nita's arrival there. Two days before he
had joined a yachting-party, but caprice, or disgust, at
the machinations of a husband-hunting young lady on
board, had inspired him with so keen a longing for escape,
that he had prevailed on his friend to set him
ashore, at an hour when plain people are just seeking
their beds.</p>

<p>"I'll seek shelter presently at that imposing old mansion
up there," he thought indifferently, and walked
musingly along the shore, thinking in weary disdain of
the woman who had persecuted him on his friend's
yacht.</p>

<p>"And all for the Mountcastle gold, not at all for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
owner," he muttered cynically. "How beautiful and
heartless women are! Shall I never be loved for myself
alone? No, I have proved that," and he turned his
face to the sea with a short, angry laugh.</p>

<p>There glided toward him across the noiseless sands,
like a spirit of evil, the bent and crouching form of an
old woman, with a hideous, scarred face, and bright, furtive
eyes. A catlike bound brought her within hearing of
his last words, and she echoed his laugh with one more
cynical and hard than his own.</p>

<p>Turning with a start of surprise, Dorian Mountcastle
beheld the witch, and exclaimed, in a tone of comic despair:</p>

<p>"Ye gods, another female! Can I not escape them
either on land or sea?"</p>

<p>"No, for a woman is destined to work you bitter woe,
young sir," replied a cracked and gibing voice.</p>

<p>"A safe prophecy, madam. Woman has worked woe
to man ever since Adam's day, and will no doubt continue
it to the end of the chapter," laughed the young
man, in a tone of careless raillery.</p>

<p>The scarred, hideous old hag was watching so greedily
the flashing diamond on his hand that she forgot to answer
him, until he touched her lightly, and asked mockingly:</p>

<p>"Are you so overcome with admiration that you cannot
speak? Who lives up there in the great house?"</p>

<p>"They are new tenants&mdash;just arrived to-night. I know
nothing about them, but the house is called Gray Gables,
and belongs to an old man in New York. You must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
a stranger, sir, not to know Gray Gables?"&mdash;with a
glance of furtive inquiry.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am a stranger. I landed here from a yacht
to-night," Dorian answered, with careless confidence.
"I'll tell you the truth, old lady. Some women badgered
me so that I was fain to jump overboard into the sea to
avoid them, so my friend, the owner of the yacht, kindly
consented to set me off here, where I'm as lonesome as
Robinson Crusoe on his desert-island."</p>

<p>"You don't know anybody at Pirate Beach?" she suggested.</p>

<p>"Not a living soul but you, my friend&mdash;no, not even
the name of the place until now. Pirate Beach! Jove,
an unpleasantly suggestive name."</p>

<p>"There's nothing in the name, though there might
have been many years ago. There's no danger now,
young sir"&mdash;wheedingly.</p>

<p>"Glad to hear it, I'm sure. Well, is there any hotel
hereabout?"</p>

<p>"A matter of five miles or so on a lonely road."</p>

<p>"Too long a tramp for a lazy man. Maybe they will
give me a bed up yonder."</p>

<p>A hoarse cry issued from the woman's lips, and, recoiling
from him, she suddenly lifted her skinny right
arm on high, and almost shrieked, so loud and uneven
was her voice:</p>

<p>"Young man, venture not now or ever beneath the
roof of Gray Gables. It is written in the stars that Fate
threatens thee there!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>Dorian Mountcastle stared, then laughed at her tragic
turn.</p>

<p>"So you are a sibyl? Come, read me a page from
the mystic stars."</p>

<p>A piece of silver crossed her skinny palm, and she
laughed in joy. There was more where that came from.
She had caught the clink in his vest pocket. She laughed,
then scowled.</p>

<p>"Oh, you may sneer," she cried angrily. "You do
not believe that old Meg can read the stars, you jest at
her art. But the time comes when you shall weep. Look
up yonder at that old gray house, so dark and forbidding,
among the trees. It has been accursed and uninhabited
for years; but to-night I see in the shining stars
a new shadow hovering, vulturelike, above it. You are
mixed up in it&mdash;you, whom fate has sent here to-night.
For you I read woe and despair. You will go mad for a
woman's love!"</p>

<p>He laughed at her in keenest mockery, this Dorian
Mountcastle, who was so tired of lovely woman and her
deceitful wiles.</p>

<p>"You are cheating me, Madam Sibyl! I know the
shallow sex too well to lose my head over any of them!"
he exclaimed, in a voice of cynical melancholy, and,
throwing her another coin, walked impatiently away to
some little distance, standing with his back to her, and
his moody face turned to the sea.</p>

<p>Meg, the fortune-teller, remained where he had left
her several moments watching him with a strange, catlike
intentness. Now and then she would throw a cautious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
glance around her, but there was no one in sight&mdash;no
one but the young man yonder with the diamond
gleaming on his hand, and his pockets full of gold&mdash;yes,
gold, for the last piece he had thrown her was yellow
and shining. A terrible cupidity was aroused in
the old crone's breast.</p>

<p>As for Dorian Mountcastle; in his careless or cynical
self-absorption he had already forgotten the woman and
her wild predictions&mdash;a fatal forgetfulness. For, as Meg
crouched there, on the shining sands, her lean claw
slipped inside the long black cloak she wore, and clutched
the hilt of a sharp knife she carried in her breast. A
low grating chuckle escaped her lips&mdash;the laugh of a
fiend&mdash;and she began to advance upon her unconscious
prey.</p>

<p>With his back to her, and his hands in his pockets, he
was watching the sea, and softly whistling a melancholy
strain from a favorite opera.</p>

<p>Meg crept close, unheard, unseen, threw out a cautious
foot, tripped him, and he fell backward on the wet
sands, ere he could extricate his hands from his pockets.</p>

<p>That instant she sprang upon her helpless victim. The
murderous knife glittered in the moonlight, then descending,
sheathed itself deep in his breast. Dorian
Mountcastle quivered all over, like one in the agonies
of a violent death, then lay quiet, at the mercy of the
murderess.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<h3>FORGOT SHE WAS A WIFE.</h3>


<p>And so Dorian Mountcastle, saved from death by
Nita's brave efforts, lay ill beneath the roof of Gray
Gables&mdash;the house of all others that the murderous old
sibyl had warned him to avoid.</p>

<p>And very pale he looked that morning when the housekeeper
entered, bearing a fancy basket, heaped high
with dew-wet roses of all colors, whose fragrance filled
the air of the sick-room with the perfumed breath of
rosy June.</p>

<p>"From Miss Farnham, with her best wishes for your
recovery," she said graciously.</p>

<p>She saw his eyes light up with eager pleasure as he
placed the flowers close to his pillow, and inhaled their
spicy fragrance.</p>

<p>"My mistress gathered them for you herself," continued
Mrs. Hill, and he looked at her in surprise.</p>

<p>"Impossible! Why, I was told that she was too ill to
leave her bed for weeks!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hill tossed her head with a knowing air, and
answered:</p>

<p>"Them that told you that, Mr. Mountcastle, wished
it might be the case, no doubt, but Miss Farnham is up
and dressed, and took breakfast with the family this
morning."</p>

<p>"Happy, happy news!" murmured the young man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>,
gladly. "She is better, thank Heaven! Oh, Mrs. Hill,
will she be kind enough to come to me and let me thank
her for so nobly saving my life?"</p>

<p>"The same ones that were so anxious to keep her
abed so long have busied themselves this morning to
persuade her that it would be highly improper for her
to visit you in your sick-room," replied the worthy housekeeper,
swelling with indignation.</p>

<p>"Pshaw! Why, Azalea has been in here a dozen
times."</p>

<p>"They told her that was quite different. You see, sir&mdash;old
friends, and all that."</p>

<p>She saw his lips curl in angry contempt under his mustache,
and he exclaimed angrily:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hill, I will not submit to this hectoring by the
Courtneys. Go at once to Miss Farnham, say distinctly
that I demand an interview. If she refuses I shall consider
myself an unwelcome guest, and depart from Gray
Gables within the hour."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, it would kill you to be moved!"</p>

<p>"No matter. I will not remain."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hill chuckled to herself, and departed on her errand
without more ado.</p>

<p>"Do come, Miss Nita, please. He's that cranky he
thinks you don't want him here, and if you don't go and
pacify him he'll go away sure, and that will be the death
of him, for the wound would get to bleeding again, and
the doctor said it mustn't on no account," she pleaded
anxiously.</p>

<p>"He has no right to demand," Nita said haughtily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
but she followed Mrs. Hill to the sick-room, somehow
glad in her secret heart of that imperious message.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hill pushed her gently over the threshold, shut
the door on the outside, and&mdash;trembling with a new timidity,
her face burning, her heart beating wildly, Nita
was alone with Dorian Mountcastle. His eager blue
eyes turned to her, dwelling on her beauty in wondering
delight.</p>

<p>"Miss Farnham," he cried, and his musical voice
thrilled her. Involuntarily, she moved nearer to him till
she stood by his side.</p>

<p>"How can I ever thank you enough for your goodness?"
he said, holding out an eager hand. She laid hers
gently in it, and as he clasped it their eyes met.</p>

<p>When love is young and new there is something wonderful
in the spell of a glance. This pair, looking into
each other's eyes, wore pale, serious faces, and felt their
hearts leap and their breath flutter unevenly over their
parted lips. They seemed looking not alone in each
other's eyes, but into each other's hearts. The veil of
conventionality had unconsciously fallen, and Nita stood
with her lips trembling, her eyes wide, solemn, half-questioning
as they met and held his devouring gaze.</p>

<p>Suddenly, she recovered her self-consciousness. She
started back, flushed vividly, and let her eyes falter
shyly from his gaze, while she murmured in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Do not try to thank me. Only live, that is all I ask!"</p>

<p>In tones of tenderness he answered:</p>

<p>"Now that you are well I hope that I shall live. But
when they told me you were so very, very ill I did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
care if I died," and impulsively he kissed the hand he
held, adding, "you know me, Miss Farnham. They have
told you my name?"</p>

<p>She drew away the hand he had kissed, her whole
frame thrilling, and with a struggle for calmness, answered
smilingly:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Courtney has told me your name and position,
and that your sojourn at Gray Gables is an honor
to us."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Mrs. Courtney knows that I am simply
a lazy young vagabond who has inherited a fine old name
and plenty of money, and that Azalea is making a dead
set at me to get it," he rejoined, almost curtly in his
vexation. "How I wish no one had recognized me here,"
he added, "then I should have palmed myself off on you
as a poor young man, and tried to win your friendship
on my personal merits."</p>

<p>"Is not that the only way, anyhow?" she queried ingenuously.</p>

<p>His blue eyes began to twinkle with the merry light
of laughter.</p>

<p>"Mercy, no, Miss Farnham, I've never had a true
friend in all my life! People value me solely for the
length of my purse. Ask Miss Courtney if that is not
true," and he smiled with sarcasm that puzzled Nita,
but that also recalled to her mind Mrs. Courtney's displeasure
if she should find her here with Dorian Mountcastle.</p>

<p>"I must go now. Mrs. Courtney did not wish me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
come in here at all," she faltered, turning toward the
door.</p>

<p>"Please stay a little while with me, won't you? There
is not the least impropriety in it, I'm sure. That old
cat is only trying to keep you in the background because
you are so&mdash;beautiful&mdash;pardon my frankness, won't you?
And do say you're not going yet. I want to thank you
for these sweet roses&mdash;and, one minute, please&mdash;I'd like
you to read to me every day to cheer me up. Will you?
It would be so good of you to come to my rescue."</p>

<p>With a merry smile she answered:</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;perhaps&mdash;you might think the same of me."</p>

<p>"Never! I only wish you would! It would make
me the happiest vagabond on earth if you only&mdash;beg pardon,
Miss Farnham, indeed I did not mean to offend,"
for she had suddenly drawn back from him, her eyes
startled, her cheeks pale, her pose haughty.</p>

<p>Nita, who for a few brief moments had been wandering
with bounding pulses and dreamy bliss through an
earthly paradise, had suddenly remembered.</p>

<p>Remembered that she was not free.</p>

<p>And Dorian Mountcastle, such a short while ago a
cynical scoffer at woman's love, gazed in alarm and surprise
at the cold white change that had come over that
lovely face that but a moment ago blushed with love
beneath his eyes.</p>

<p>"Your pardon&mdash;I spoke lightly&mdash;but I meant no offense,"
he repeated anxiously.</p>

<p>She turned on him the full gaze of her large eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
somber now and grave with secret pain, and their sadness
pierced his heart.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, Mr. Mountcastle, I am not offended. Do
not fancy such a thing, but&mdash;I&mdash;I have forgotten something.
I must go&mdash;this moment," she answered gently,
but incoherently, and almost staggering to the door,
half-blinded by starting tears, she tore it open and hastened
out.</p>

<p>In the strange confusion of her abrupt departure Nita
did not notice that she had left Dorian Mountcastle's
room by a door exactly opposite to the one she had entered.</p>

<p>But in a moment she realized that she had blundered.
She found herself in a dark, narrow, carpetless corridor,
with closed doors frowning grimly upon her from either
side of the moldy-smelling hall.</p>

<p>"It must be the servant's quarters, but I will try to escape
this way. I cannot possibly go back through his
room," she murmured, and pursued her way timorously
along the hall, soon losing herself in an intricacy of abrupt
turnings and obscure passages seeming to have no
outlet.</p>

<p>"How strange," she murmured uneasily; "I do not
seem to be finding my way out at all, and perhaps I could
not find it back to Mr. Mountcastle's room. Ah! there
is a narrow door and a dark little stairway. I suppose it
will lead me out-doors into the garden," and Nita began
to descend the dark, rickety old stairway, all unconscious
of the startling discovery she was on the eve of making,
or she would have fled back in an agony of terror.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<h3>IN DEADLY PERIL.</h3>


<p>Slowly and carefully Nita went down the dark, narrow,
dusty steps to the rickety door at the foot, expecting
confidently that it would lead her straight out-doors,
most probably into the kitchen-garden. She found the
door slightly ajar, pushed it quickly open, and found herself,
without warning or premonition, in a small, dingy,
cobwebby room, full of gloomy shadows, and dimly
lighted by a flaring dip, in an old battered tin candlestick.</p>

<p>The little closetlike chamber, barely eight feet wide,
was furnished with a small table, and an arm-chair, over
which was thrown a coarse, dark-gray blanket. Against
the walls were ranged a large number of small, iron-bound
chests, similar to the one up-stairs in Nita's closet.
The lids of several were open, and the wondering girl
saw that they were filled to the brim with money, that
gleamed bright and yellow in the flaring, uncertain light
of the solitary candle.</p>

<p>But not even all this hoarded gold could have surprised
Nita as did the central figure of it all&mdash;the old
man kneeling with his back to her over one of the open
chests, and running his shriveled fingers through the
bright coins, while his lips worked nervously, emitting
chuckling and guttural noises of ghoulish delight.</p>

<p>Nita's instant alarm struck her dumb. She was for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the moment incapable of speech or motion. She could
only stare in an appalled silence. She had recognized in
the crouching old man gloating over his treasure her
miser-husband, Charles Farnham, whom she had supposed
to be far away from this place, according to the
terms of the marriage-contract.</p>

<p>Even while she gazed there crept over her a sensation
of deadly fear and dread, that seemed to freeze the very
blood in her veins. She thought in wild alarm:</p>

<p>"I have blundered upon this secret, and the accident
may cost me my life. Heaven help me to escape before
he discovers me!"</p>

<p>Absorbed in his fascinating employment, the miser
had not noticed her entrance. He continued to play
with the gold like a child, pouring it from one trembling
hand to the other, muttering and chuckling in a strange
ecstasy.</p>

<p>Nita summoned all her will-power to break the thrall
of terror that seemed to hold her limbs immovable. Suddenly,
the power of motion returned. She turned softly,
made two catlike steps, and was on the stairs on the other
side of the door, safe&mdash;ah, what was that grating sound?</p>

<p>In drawing the door softly to behind her the rusty
hinge had creaked harshly! Nita's heart gave a bound
of deadly fear, she gasped for breath, and sprang wildly
forward.</p>

<p>If only she could reach the corridor above with its intricate
windings, she could elude pursuit in some dark
corner.</p>

<p>But from the room she had left came a sound between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
a howl and a groan, and the old man bounded to the
stairs with such wondrous agility that his outstretched
hand caught the long skirts of the escaping girl, and
dragged her ruthlessly backward.</p>

<p>Clutching her fiercely, in spite of her cries and struggles
for liberty, and bearing her forward into the light,
he gazed eagerly into her face. A bitter oath escaped
his lips as he beheld in his struggling captive the face of
his beautiful, unloving bride.</p>

<p>To Nita, with her nerves yet unstrung by sickness and
excitement, the sight of the old miser's face, distorted
by rage and surprise, was absolutely terrifying.</p>

<p>She trembled like a leaf in his rude grasp, and moans
of terror came from her blanched lips.</p>

<p>"Spy!" he hissed angrily, and in the fierce malevolent
gleam of his snakelike eyes she read a wild temptation
to grasp her fair white throat in his strong hands and
throttle her to death.</p>

<p>"Spy! You have followed me here!" the old man
hissed again savagely.</p>

<p>He shook her rudely until the breath had almost left
her body, then flung her upon one of the chests, and,
locking the little door, dropped the key into his pocket.
She was at the mercy of this fiendish old man who had
come into her life so strangely, and at so dark an hour.</p>

<p>"Release me, oh, release me!" she gasped faintly,
pleadingly, but he looked at her with pitiless eyes, and
answered:</p>

<p>"Once before a woman, filled with the greed for gold,
followed me here to find out the secret of my hidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
treasures. Well&mdash;her friends are searching for her yet,
as perchance yours will be, too, for many a year."</p>

<p>"You murdered her!" gasped Nita, with a creeping
thrill of utter horror.</p>

<p>"No," he replied, and after a moment's pause continued
with a hideous leer:</p>

<p>"I simply left her locked in this room and went away,
leaving her alone with the treasure she coveted. It was
a long, long time before I came back, and then&mdash;I found
her still here."</p>

<p>"Still here!" the startled captive repeated. He saw
the shudder that crept over her frame, and laughed mockingly.</p>

<p>"Still here&mdash;waiting for me still," he sneered. "Always
here, waiting for me when I come. Look!"</p>

<p>Turning from her, he threw aside the dark blanket
that had draped the chair by the table. Nita looked and
shrieked aloud.</p>

<p>The coarse blanket had concealed the fleshless skeleton
of a human being sitting at ease in the chair, with
the bony digits of one hand resting on the table. About
the neck was clasped a golden chain with a shining pendant,
while on one finger gleamed a magnificent emerald
ring, ghastly mockery of adornment.</p>

<p>Nita's overstrained nerves gave way at the startling
sight. She crouched upon the chest of gold with her
hands before her eyes, while appalling shrieks burst from
her lips.</p>

<p>She doubted not the same awful fate would be her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
own, despite the fact that she was bound to Charles
Farnham by the most solemn tie.</p>

<p>At her shrieks he turned upon her with the fierce
command:</p>

<p>"Silence! Do not think that your cries will bring
assistance to this vault! This wing of Gray Gables is
utterly uninhabited and isolated from the newer part of
the house. You are wholly in my power and at my
mercy to punish as I will."</p>

<p>From his excited, remorseless face she doubted not
what that punishment would be&mdash;isolation and starvation
in the miser's hidden treasure-vault in company with
that awful thing yonder, the ghastly, grinning, jewel-bedecked
skeleton.</p>

<p>There came a swift thought of Dorian Mountcastle.
She should never see him again. Would he miss the
girl into whose eyes he had gazed with such passion?
Would the mystery of her strange fate sadden his life?
She cried out, rebelliously:</p>

<p>"Punish at your will! Yet I have done nothing&mdash;nothing!"
and, falling on her knees, she poured out impetuously
the story of the mistake in opening the door
that had brought her to this terrible strait.</p>

<p>"Through no fault of mine," she sobbed wildly. "Yet&mdash;yet&mdash;I
am to suffer death for this unconscious wrong.
Ah, sir, how can you be so cruel? Why, then, did you
save me from the river for this more terrible fate?"</p>

<p>He stood silent, gazing at the beautiful, convulsed face.
Yes, it was scarce a week since he had turned her aside
from a self-sought death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>He remembered her strange, almost stoical calm, in
such contrast with her wild agitation now. Life had
grown sweeter, dearer now since that day in Central
Park, when, starving and friendless, she had derided
him with the scorn of a hopeless and reckless despair.</p>

<p>"Let me go free, only give me my liberty, and the secret
I have unwillingly discovered shall never pass my
lips!" she cried frantically. "Do you remember that day
in the park when you pretended that you loved me?
Then, how can you be so cruel?"</p>

<p>The old miser's face changed suddenly from rage and
malevolence to a leering softness more hateful still to
her shrinking eyes. He came closer, and she started back
in disgust.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<h3>THE SERPENT RING.</h3>


<p>"Ah, Nita, you remember that day still!" cried the
old man in a transport of joy. "You remember that
you are my wife! Do you know that in my wrath I had
almost forgotten it? And so you appeal to my love?
Have you none to give me in return, pretty one?"</p>

<p>As he approached her she thrust him violently back
with hands that were nerved by the strength of fear and
hate.</p>

<p>"Do not touch me, do not ask me for love. Remember
our marriage-contract!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I remember it," he answered, gazing on her with
fiery eyes. "But, listen, Nita; I will give you one chance
of escape from the doom that hangs over you. Burn
the marriage-contract. Become my wife in reality as
you are now only in name, and we will begin our new
life to-day. I love you, Nita, but only on these terms
can you regain your freedom."</p>

<p>She shrank back with dilated eyes full of horror, and
cried:</p>

<p>"I would not abridge one hour of that year if twenty
lives were at stake. Ah, no, no, no&mdash;sooner death!"</p>

<p>"So be it!" he exclaimed bitterly, incensed by her
scorn, and pointing to the skeleton. "I will go now and
leave you to the companionship of this grim lady whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
fate you will share." He moved toward the door, but
she sprang before him with desperate courage to do
battle for her liberty.</p>

<p>"Do not dare to leave me here!" she cried imperiously.
"Listen to me, you wicked wretch! If you leave me here
to perish with this woman you have already murdered,
I&mdash;while I am dying of starvation here in this gold-vault,
surrounded by enough wealth to feed famishing
thousands&mdash;I will curse you with my latest breath! I,
to whom Heaven will listen because I am good and
friendless, will pray God to chastise you with a terrible
punishment, and to bring down on you a death even
more awful than mine. And after death I will haunt
you night and day, if such things can be, until I drive
you mad with horror."</p>

<p>Before the solemn force of Nita's frenzied adjuration,
the old man started and grew ashen pale. His eyes
glared, his knees trembled. She saw quickly that her
desperate words had some effect upon him, and continued:</p>

<p>"See, I will take an oath, if you let me go free, never
to reveal the secret of what I have seen here to-night,
never to enter this place again. The secret of your hidden
wealth, and of this murdered woman, shall be as
though I had never known it. Will not this suffice?"</p>

<p>Charles Farnham did not answer at first. With bowed
head and ashen features, he remained in deep thought
several minutes, while Nita waited in keen anxiety. Then
he looked up, and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>"You promise to take a solemn oath! Very well. For
the love I bear you I will spare your life. But there is
one condition."</p>

<p>"Yes," she breathed eagerly.</p>

<p>"You note the ring on that skeleton-hand there?
Come nearer, Nita, and examine it. You shudder. A
coiled serpent, with quivering, emerald scales, you observe.
Is it not magnificent and unique? It has a history,
and was made for this woman by a foreign artisan,
who then destroyed the pattern. Note the tiny quivering
gold wires that uphold each emerald scale. At the least
movement of the hand the serpent-head seems to raise
itself, and the eyes and scales to glow with malignant
greenish fire."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," she answered impatiently. "But the condition,
sir&mdash;the condition?"</p>

<p>Scowling darkly at her, he hissed rather than spoke:</p>

<p>"That you take your oath of silence with that skeleton
hand clasped in your own, and afterward withdraw the
serpent-ring from that bony finger, and wear it always,
in memory of this hour."</p>

<p>She shuddered and recoiled at first, then, catching
the gleam of triumph in his eye, answered, with apparent
calm:</p>

<p>"I agree to your condition."</p>

<p>With an evil, jeering smile, he said:</p>

<p>"Perchance there are people yet alive who have never
given up the hope of tearing aside the thick veil of mystery
that enshrouds the fate of this woman. If you wear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
this ring you may meet them&mdash;they will recognize it, they
will ask you questions that you will not dare to answer."</p>

<p>Her brain was reeling, her limbs trembled, her strength
was fast going in this atmosphere of horror, but there
was an element of desperate bravery in the girl when
driven to bay. She answered her tormentor:</p>

<p>"Only give me my liberty, and I will risk it all&mdash;all!"</p>

<p>The die was cast. He looked at her for a moment
with a strange expression, and exclaimed warningly:</p>

<p>"One moment, please. You will remember that you
will have no chance to prove a traitor to your oath, even
if you dared. This door I shall wall up immediately, as
there is a secret entrance that I shall use hereafter. So
beware of attempted treachery, girl."</p>

<p>With a shudder she replied:</p>

<p>"The wealth of the Indies would not tempt me to return
to this dreadful place! Now, the oath."</p>

<p>With wolfish eyes he saw her white hand close shrinkingly
over the dead one on the table. Sepulchrally he
spake some words which Nita repeated after him through
stiff white lips, her eyes dilated with horror.</p>

<p>Then she drew the glistening ring from the skeleton's
bony hand, and placed it on her third finger. The emerald
scales quivered with greenish fire, and a shock as of
electricity seemed to thrill through her at the contact.
Repressing a cry of terror, she turned toward the stairway.</p>

<p>"You must return the way you came," said Farnham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
unlocking the door, and holding it ajar. "Good-by, Nita,
and do not forget the oath sworn on the dead hand."</p>

<p>But the girl was speechless. Flitting past him like a
shadow she crept up the stairway, and heard with silent
thanksgiving the lock turn in the door, between her and
the miser's gold-vault.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<h3>"WILL YOU NEVER FORGIVE?"</h3>


<p>When Nita had left him, Dorian Mountcastle lay with
half-shut eyes in a delicious reverie. Believing himself
proof against all the darts of Cupid, he had yet gone
down helplessly before the fire of a girl's dark eyes, and
the charm of her sweet, sad smile. Upon his life's horizon
had dawned the radiant star of Love.</p>

<p>He forgot his weakness and illness in the intoxication
of the moment. He was too well versed in the signs
of love not to interpret aright Nita's looks and blushes.
It only brought a smile to his lips when he recalled her
strange pallor and sudden flight.</p>

<p>"Sweet girl, she was frightened and agitated at the
sudden discovery mutually made that our hearts had
leaped to meet each other. She will return when she
recovers her composure," he thought happily.</p>

<p>A light tap at the door, then it opened softly, and his
heart leaped at the thought that it might be Nita already
returning. But it was only Azalea Courtney, radiant
as the morning, carrying a little silver pitcher full
of iced lemonade.</p>

<p>"Alone, Dorian? I thought Miss Farnham was with
you?" she cooed, in silvery tones.</p>

<p>"You were mistaken," he replied coldly, vexed that
she had disturbed his sweet love-reverie, and out of mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
perversity he refused to drink the draft she proffered,
declaring that he was not thirsty.</p>

<p>But if he thought to freeze out his dainty visitor by
his indifference he was mistaken. She slipped into the
arm-chair by his bed, and began with pretty raillery:</p>

<p>"Miss Farnham made you but a short visit. I fear
you did not make a good impression."</p>

<p>"I should be sorry to think so, for in that case I should
feel compelled to leave Gray Gables immediately, and
be jolted five miles to the nearest hotel," he rejoined
maliciously.</p>

<p>"Leave us, Dorian? Indeed, you should not. It would
kill you to be moved. Besides, what does it matter what
that girl thinks, so long as mama and I are delighted to
have you, and to be of service to you?"</p>

<p>"It matters everything, Azalea, since Miss Farnham
is the real mistress here. Remember your mama is only
her salaried chaperon, and you, like myself, but a transient
guest."</p>

<p>Azalea pouted prettily at this rebuke.</p>

<p>"You take pleasure in reminding me of my poverty&mdash;you
forget the past," she half-sobbed, and he answered
impatiently:</p>

<p>"I choose to ignore it, and, pardon me, but it is bad
taste in you to recur to it."</p>

<p>"Ah, Dorian, will you never forgive?&mdash;never permit
me to atone?" she sighed.</p>

<p>The young man made a gesture of impatient scorn, as
though dismissing an unwelcome subject, and half-buried
his face in the roses that still lay beside his pillow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Azalea Courtney knew that Nita had sent the roses. A
spasm of mingled pain and bitterness crossed the pretty,
pink-and-white face, and she cried out sharply:</p>

<p>"Well, how do you like Miss Farnham?"</p>

<p>He knew well how to stab this dainty beauty&mdash;perhaps
he knew, too, that she deserved it. He looked
straight into her curious blue eyes, and answered enthusiastically:</p>

<p>"She is charming!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" breathed Azalea, with her little white hand
pressed against her side to still her heart's jealous throbs.</p>

<p>"She is charming," repeated Dorian Mountcastle, quite
oblivious to her pain, and, furious with anger, Azalea
darted from her seat and left the room as precipitately
as Nita had done a while ago&mdash;left the room to hurry
to her mother and sob out her jealous longing for vengeance
upon dark-eyed Nita, her beautiful rival.</p>

<p>Without the least compunction over the stab he had
given his visitor, Dorian Mountcastle dismissed all
thoughts of her, and again fell to dreaming of the girl
who had bewitched him.</p>

<p>Beautiful women he had seen in plenty, but hovering
about this one there was something more than beauty.
With closed eyes he lay silent, breathing the fragrance
of the roses by his pillow, and going over in his enraptured
mind all her separate, distinctive charms.</p>

<p>Suddenly, he started broad-awake, his brow beaded
with dews of terror, his heart throbbing painfully. What
was the sound that had awakened him? Ah, a timid
tapping over and over again upon the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Enter!" he called out in a strangled voice, and the
door opened and closed again, admitting&mdash;Nita!</p>

<p>Nita, pale and gasping, with wild eyes and disheveled
tresses, her white gown soiled with soot and cobwebs, her
slender hands grimy with dust, outstretched before her
like a sleep-walker's, as she staggered across to him,
gasping, it seemed, with mortal terror, vainly essaying
to speak.</p>

<p>"My dream, my dream!" he cried, in a voice of agony,
as she sank with a long, quivering sigh into the arm-chair
close to the bed.</p>

<p>Putting out his hand he touched hers. It was icy cold,
and he saw on it a ring that he had not noticed before,
a serpent, with eyes and scales of quivering greenish fire.
It was so lifelike in its malignant semblance that he
shuddered through all his frame.</p>

<p>At his gentle touch, Nita started, and lifted her dazed
dark eyes to his face. Their expression was piteous, and
so was her voice, as she murmured incoherently:</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;went out at the wrong door&mdash;and&mdash;was lost&mdash;oh,
I was so frightened!"</p>

<p>Her eyes closed, her head drooped heavily. Drawing
her hastily toward him, her pale face sank upon the
roses by his pillow. She was unconscious.</p>

<p>It was a mean advantage to take of the helpless girl,
but Dorian could not resist the temptation. The dark
curls on her white brow mingled with his own fairer
ones, and the lovely lips were close.</p>

<p>He turned his face slightly, and his eager mouth
brushed hers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>The pressure of his lips recalled her ebbing senses.
She stirred slightly, opened her eyes in a dreamy fashion,
realized everything, and started back from him in sweet
and strange dismay.</p>

<p>"Nita, Nita, I love you!" Dorian murmured, as she
looked at him with bewildered eyes, but ere she could
reply the door opened, and Mrs. Hill, her faithful nurse,
entered the room. The girl sprang up and clasped her
around the neck, sobbing hysterically.</p>

<p>"Do not look at me so angrily, Mrs. Hill, indeed I have
done nothing. Miss Farnham went out at that door
yonder, got lost in the winding corridors, and found her
way back here almost frightened out of her senses," explained
Dorian.</p>

<p>"Oh, take me to my room," pleaded the girl, drawing
the kindly housekeeper toward the door without a
backward glance at her lover.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<h3>"IT IS THE RING."</h3>


<p>Nita was walking alone in the grounds at twilight.
The purple shades of the gloaming were shot through
by the opaline light of a new moon swinging like a silver
sickle in a rosy-lilac sky, and a wind from the sea&mdash;cool,
salty, and delicious&mdash;stirred the flowers, shaking
out fragrance upon the languid, love-breathing air of
June.</p>

<p>The beautiful white-robed girl, as she walked up and
down the flowery paths, cast now and then glances of
yearning tenderness toward one window of the house,
through whose lace-curtains gleamed a dim, soft light.
She knew that Dorian Mountcastle was waiting there,
heart-sick and restless, and pining for her presence.</p>

<p>A little while ago Lizette had brought her a note that
set all her pulses beating with blended rapture and despair:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Miss Farnham</span>: How can you be so cruel
to a sick and lonely man? It is a week since I have seen
you. Mrs. Hill keeps making excuses that you are not
well, but how can I believe it when I have seen you from
my window every day walking, riding, and even boating,
rowing yourself with the most consummate grace and
skill? Azalea also tells me you are very well. She is
devoted to me, the dear girl, but it is you I want.</p>

<p>"Do you know that I am so much better the doctor
let me sit up several hours to-day, and that I shall soon
be well enough to go away? I am glad, for I have already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
trespassed too long on your hospitality, and, of
course, you will wish me gone, else you would let me
see you when I am so miserable over your displeasure.
How cruelly you punish me for that sweet stolen kiss,
whose memory thrills my every hour with silent rapture.
Ah, Nita, I love you madly! Will you accept the
life you saved so bravely that night and make me happy?</p>

<p>"You remember that sweet old song 'Juanita'? It
keeps singing itself over and over in my thronging
thoughts:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Nita, Juanita, let me linger by thy side;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nita, Juanita, be my own fair bride!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Ah, Nita, did not our souls rush together at our first
meeting? I remember with intoxicating rapture how
we looked into each other's eyes&mdash;looked and loved. Oh,
my dearest, do not be cold to me. You are no heartless
coquette, I know. Forego all further punishment. Come
to me, dear, and set my heart at rest.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Dorian.</span>"
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The letter was in Nita's bosom. The sweetness and
the thorn were in her heart. She wrung her slender
hands together, as if in pain, then they fell apart, and a
stifled cry came from her lips.</p>

<p>The keen little tongue of the emerald serpent had
pierced her rosy palm and the blood started. But the
wound in the young girl's heart was deeper far.</p>

<p>Everything around Nita&mdash;the moon, the flowers, the
sea, breathed of love. What wonder that the same pulse
throbbed at her heart! She leaned on the railing of a
little fountain throwing diamond sprays into the air, and
murmured plaintively:</p>

<p>"If this had come to me only two weeks ago it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
have opened the gates of heaven to me. To love&mdash;to
be loved&mdash;that is the best of life. But I have lived to
be almost eighteen, and never had this crowning joy&mdash;never
until now, when it comes, alas, too late. Ah,
would it be so very wrong to love him just a little while?
I have just one year of life, for I have sworn to die ere
the moment comes of giving myself to Miser Farnham's
arms. One year&mdash;only year in this beautiful world! Oh,
it is cruel, cruel! And life has been so hard to me;
who could blame me for taking this joy that fate holds
out to me, this draft of love whose dregs will be so bitter?"</p>

<p>Hungry for love and happiness, the girl was faltering
with a terrible temptation. For a week she had held it
at bay. To-night Love stood sentinel at the door of
her heart and proclaimed himself her master.</p>

<p>That night in the old garden when she had believed
Dorian Mountcastle dead, she had uttered prophetic
words:</p>

<p>"If you had lived, you would have lured my heart
from me."</p>

<p>Only time could prove whether it was for better or
worse that he had lived, and that they had looked and
loved.</p>

<p>"I must go to him!" she cried suddenly, sweeping all
irresolution aside.</p>

<p>She gathered a lily from the marble basin of the fountain,
fastened it in the bosom of her white gown, and
turned toward the house. Coming into the graveled
walk at the foot of the steps, Nita almost ran into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
arms of a tall, middle-aged man, who lifted his hat with
easy grace, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Farnham," the young girl said quietly, and stood
waiting.</p>

<p>He bowed deeply, and resumed in his easy courteous
manner:</p>

<p>"My name is Donald Kayne, Miss Farnham, and I am
in search of a missing friend of mine, Dorian Mountcastle.
I set him ashore on this beach about two weeks ago,
and on returning only yesterday from our little yachting
excursion, I heard that he had not returned to New York,
nor even been heard of there. I became uneasy and came
down to-day to hunt him up, although now"&mdash;with an
admiring glance&mdash;"his exile is no longer a mystery to
me. I learned at the hotel of my friend's accident, and
that he was your guest. I hastened without ceremony
to call on him."</p>

<p>"You are most welcome," she answered, in a low, musical
voice.</p>

<p>"Thank you; and is he better?"</p>

<p>"He will soon be well," she murmured&mdash;"you will
come to him at once, sir. He will be glad indeed to see
his friend."</p>

<p>He followed her up the stately granite steps into a
broad marble-paved hall. Then Nita led him to Dorian
Mountcastle.</p>

<p>The invalid was resting in an easy chair, and Mrs.
Courtney and her daughter were with him in spite of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
only half-suppressed yawns with which he slyly evidenced
a decided preference for solitude.</p>

<p>He was waiting for Nita's answer to his letter. Would
she come, his proud, dark-eyed darling, would she forgive
his audacity and grant his prayer? And, meanwhile,
Mrs. Courtney and Azalea were engaged in holding
her up to his scorn.</p>

<p>"The most singular young girl I ever met. She makes
the duties of a chaperon merely a sinecure," sneered
Mrs. Courtney, and Azalea chimed in with pretended
sweet excuses:</p>

<p>"But, then, mama, dear, you must remember that the
poor girl does not really seem to have any knowledge
of the usages of the best society. I fancy her wealth
must have come to her quite suddenly. She cannot
play the piano, Dorian, nor sing a note. She knows no
language but English, she is brusk, and&mdash;&mdash;" But the
sentence uttered in a clear, high-pitched voice, was never
ended.</p>

<p>The door that already stood slightly ajar, to admit the
evening air, was pushed open by a graceful hand, and
Nita stood on the threshold with the stranger. She had
heard, for, looking straight at her dismayed rival, she
said archly:</p>

<p>"You are quite right, Miss Courtney, I was brought
up in poverty until a few weeks ago, when I came into
my&mdash;inheritance."</p>

<p>Cool, fair, queenly, she bowed to Dorian, and said
simply:</p>

<p>"Your friend, Mr. Kayne."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Donald Kayne!" cried Dorian joyfully.</p>

<p>A confusion ensued in which Nita's daring speech
was happily passed over. The Courtneys were well acquainted
with the newcomer. In their palmy days they
had been in his "set," and, although surprised to see
them here, he greeted them with the easy cordiality of
a man of the world.</p>

<p>A lively conversation ensued from which Nita seemed
for a short while necessarily left out. She withdrew to
the only vacant seat, regretting that she could not conveniently
move the heavy arm-chair away from the strong
glare of light.</p>

<p>She leaned back, with languid grace, her eyes downcast,
a hovering smile on her scarlet lips, her exquisite
arm escaping from the lace of the loose sleeve, resting on
the arm of the dark velvet chair, the taper, extending
fingers quivering with a slight nervous motion that made
the serpent-ring glitter so weirdly one would scarcely
have been more startled to hear a sibilant hiss escape
from the open jaws.</p>

<p>Nita was unconscious that the stranger's eyes dwelt
admiringly upon her queenly beauty as she sat in the
velvet arm-chair. She kept her lids lowered persistently,
not daring to meet Dorian's ardent gaze.</p>

<p>But, suddenly, she became aware that Mr. Kayne had
left his seat and was bending over her chair. His breath
swept her cheek as he exclaimed eagerly:</p>

<p>"A very unique ring, Miss Farnham. Will you permit
me to examine it closer?"</p>

<p>He took the white hand in his own and lifted it nearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
to the light. His fingers felt as cold as the skeleton
ones, from which she had drawn the uncanny ring in
the miser's gold-vault, and they were trembling strangely.
Every one was watching him curiously, the pale, repressed
excitement of his countenance was so fascinating.</p>

<p>"Good heavens! it is the ring! Miss Farnham, how
came you by it?" he cried out in such a startled, eager
voice that she quivered with deadly fear, recalling in
dismay the old miser's malicious words:</p>

<p>"People will recognize the ring&mdash;they will ask you
questions that you will not dare to answer."</p>

<p>"The ring&mdash;I&mdash;oh&mdash;you must have made a mistake,"
she faltered, almost imploringly.</p>

<p>"Impossible! I know the jewel perfectly. I will prove
it to you. Inside the serpent-ring there is carved a name&mdash;'Pepita'&mdash;is
it not true? You know it. Come, Miss
Farnham, you have solved the mystery of that woman's
fate, or you would not wear her ring. The truth, the
truth, for God's sake!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<h3>ALL FOR A WOMAN'S SAKE.</h3>


<p>Donald Kayne's usual calm demeanor had given place
to the wildest agitation. His dark-gray eyes were black
with excitement, his brow was corrugated with wrinkles,
his chin quivered nervously, and his glance seemed to
pierce Nita through and through, it was so keen and
fierce. His outburst had been so sudden that at first
no one moved or spoke, only gazed in speechless astonishment
at the strange scene enacting before their eyes.</p>

<p>With a pale face, full of dread and dismay, Nita stared
up into the man's half-stern, half-entreating countenance,
but her beautiful lips were dumb.</p>

<p>"Speak," Donald Kayne cried out to her, hoarsely.
"Speak!"</p>

<p>The dry, parched lips of the girl unclosed, and she
gasped:</p>

<p>"Oh, forgive me, sir; I cannot, dare not, answer you!"</p>

<p>"Cannot&mdash;dare not! By Heaven, you shall! Tell me,
how came you by that ring, girl?"</p>

<p>He gripped her delicate wrist with unconscious violence,
and she shrank and moaned. Instantly the spell
of wonder that had held Dorian Mountcastle relaxed,
and the young man, springing up, caught Donald Kayne's
arm in a grasp of steel.</p>

<p>"Release Miss Farnham's wrist this moment. Beg her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
pardon for this outrage, or you shall answer to me for
this violence to my promised wife!"</p>

<p>The deep, angry words thrilled through every one
like an electric shock. A startled murmur came from
every lip, and Donald Kayne's grasp fell inertly from
Nita's wrist. That instant Dorian bent and whispered
hoarsely in her ear:</p>

<p>"Do not deny it. Let me claim you, if only for a
little while, that I may protect you. You have not a
friend in the room but myself."</p>

<p>She knew that it was true. In her forlorn state it
was sweet to have this true heart for her shield. She
bowed in silent acquiescence, and he turned proudly to
his friend.</p>

<p>"You have forgotten yourself in your strange curiosity,
Kayne. You must apologize to Miss Farnham for your
offense," he said sternly.</p>

<p>A devil was aroused in the man before him. He stood
erect, pale as death, his eyes wild with wrath and pain,
and gazed defiantly at Dorian.</p>

<p>"What if I refuse?" he sneered.</p>

<p>"You shall answer to me for your folly," was the instant
reply, and a little shriek from Azalea followed the
words.</p>

<p>Donald Kayne stood silent a moment. He was a man
of strong passions, but he was striving now to master
himself.</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Dorian, my old friend," he said hoarsely.
"You do not understand this affair, or you would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
not interfere. This young lady ought to explain to me
how she came by this ring. It is only humanity to do
so. I crave your patience while I explain."</p>

<p>Under the stern control he was putting upon face
and voice every one saw that there was absolute agony.
No one spoke, and he went on:</p>

<p>"Fourteen years ago a beautiful, rich, and happy
woman disappeared from her home in New York, leaving
absolutely no trace behind her to guide her friends
in their search. Upon her hand she wore that emerald
serpent-ring, and it is the first clue to her fate I have
stumbled over. She was dear to me, this woman, and
there are times when I have almost gone mad over the
mystery of her fate!</p>

<p>"Bear with me a little longer. This has come upon
me like a blow. Listen, my friends, listen you, Miss
Farnham: For fourteen years a cloud of mystery has
hung over Pepita's fate, and the hissing voice of calumny
has assailed her fair fame. Some believe that she
fled with a lover&mdash;she, Pepita, who was a wedded wife.
Others believe she met with foul play. But the veil of
blackest mystery has never been lifted. We know not if
she be alive or dead, although thousands upon thousands
of dollars have been spent in following uncertain clues.</p>

<p>"At last I am startled at the sight of her ring upon
another woman's hand. I am betrayed into harshness
most excusable when you consider the cause. Only
think, if Miss Farnham will but tell me how she came by
the serpent-ring, she will put into my hands a new clue
to work upon that will lead most surely to&mdash;Pepita and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
vengeance! If she has a woman's tender heart in her
breast, how can she refuse to speak and tell me?"</p>

<p>He looked at Nita with imploring eyes. He saw agony
upon her face, and thought it was relenting. He fell
down upon his knees before the beautiful girl as though
she had been a queen and he a slave. He held out his
hands imploringly.</p>

<p>"See! I kneel to you," he said prayerfully. "I sue to
you for that which seems so simple a favor that you
should have granted it at the first word. Ah! Miss
Farnham, what fair reason can you have for this obstinate
silence?"</p>

<p>The unhappy girl shuddered as she recalled the oath
of silence sworn upon the dead hand of Pepita, whose
ring she wore&mdash;Pepita, whose awful fate was so much to
this man kneeling at her feet, yet must remain forever a
secret in her breast.</p>

<p>In her heart swelled up a wave of pity and regret for
hapless Donald Kayne. She felt no anger that he reviled
her; she could only sympathize with him in his
great despair&mdash;despair that matched her own. Appalled
by her silence, he cried:</p>

<p>"Still silent? Why, then, you have no woman's heart
in your breast. Your beauty is cold and soulless like a
marble statue. What can I say to you? Will gold move
you? A million shall be poured at your feet! Would
you shed my heart's blood? It shall flow. Only one
word to take my heart off the rack&mdash;one word! Will
you not speak it?"</p>

<p>It was breaking her heart to blast all his hopes, to refuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
his prayer. She held out her clasped hands to him
and the serpent-ring on her finger seemed to mock him
with its uncanny glitter. She cried out, in a solemn
voice like one praying:</p>

<p>"Oh, pity me, pardon me! My heart breaks for you,
but&mdash;I can tell you nothing, nothing."</p>

<p>"You refuse!" he exclaimed, like one stunned.</p>

<p>"I refuse," she answered, her arms falling, her voice
a low moan of the most utter despair.</p>

<p>Instantly a change came over Donald Kayne. He
sprang to his feet, trembling with rage, his eyes blazing.</p>

<p>"You have the most cruel heart the world ever knew,"
he cried bitterly. "God pity my friend there who loves
you. You will ruin his life, you heartless beauty. You
will part us two, for you have made an enemy of me, and
he will be my friend no more. But, mark you, Miss
Farnham, you have baffled me now, but yet I feel I have
a clue to Pepita. I will find out yet how you came by
the serpent-ring. If there is anything you have to fear
in the knowledge, beware, for your past life shall become
an unsealed book to me, and&mdash;&mdash;" but his ravings
were interrupted by an angry voice in his ear:</p>

<p>"Not another word. Be she right or wrong I stand by
her as my own. Your violence has destroyed our friendship.
Go now, and for those words you have spoken,
remember you will hear from me soon."</p>

<p>Donald Kayne bowed with a sneering smile that included
all the occupants of the room, then walked proudly
out of the open door to which Dorian's finger pointed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<h3>SECRET PLANS.</h3>


<p>Dorian turned quickly back to Nita, without observing
that Azalea Courtney had slipped through the door in
pursuit of Mr. Kayne. The little beauty's heart was
seething with rage and pain over Dorian's announcement
that Nita was his promised wife, and in Donald Kayne's
anger she saw a chance of revenge by joining forces
with him in persecuting the young girl. Following him
down the steps to the shadowy grounds, she detained
him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Kayne, wait, please! I&mdash;I want to speak to
you," she purred.</p>

<p>He turned impatiently, and frowned. He knew Azalea
well, and despised her as thoroughly as did Dorian
Mountcastle. Yet when she came across his path to
tempt him like a serpent, he listened.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Kayne, I know I can help you to find out
about that ring if you will accept my services," she continued.</p>

<p>Donald Kayne looked keenly into the lifted face, whose
luminous blue eyes glittered wickedly in the moonlight,
and that look decided him. He drew her arm through
his, and they walked on among the tall shrubberies, in
earnest conversation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mrs. Courtney, as soon as the others were
gone, walked over to Dorian and Nita, and said stiffly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Permit me to offer you both my best wishes for your
happiness, although the affair is very hasty, is it not?
And do you think your guardian will approve, Miss
Farnham?"</p>

<p>Instantly, Nita, who had been drooping wearily in her
chair, lifted her head with a terrified cry.</p>

<p>"He must not know. Oh, Mrs. Courtney, you will
not betray me!"</p>

<p>"Betray you, child? What strange words! Of course
your guardian must know this."</p>

<p>"I shall write him at once, madam," began Dorian
haughtily, but, to his surprise, Nita faltered, imploringly:</p>

<p>"No, no, Dorian; he need not know it for a little while.
He will think, like Mrs. Courtney, that we were too
hasty. He will not approve!"</p>

<p>"I am sure he will not," echoed the chaperon decidedly.</p>

<p>And the young man looked irresolutely from one
speaker to the other. Nita knew, with a woman's keen
instinct, that she could manage her lover, but she was
not so sure of Mrs. Courtney. So it was to the lady she
addressed herself first.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Courtney, be kind to me," she pleaded.
"My guardian is a hard, stern, old man. He will be so
angry, if he learns the truth, that he will separate me
at once from Dorian. I pray you be kind to us. Let
us be happy together just a little while first, and I will
never cease to be grateful."</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney revolved the matter in her mind a moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
but it was no sympathy with the lovers, only keen
self-interest that decided her to grant Nita's earnest
prayer. With apparent suavity, she said:</p>

<p>"I know I am doing wrong, but I am too tender-hearted
to refuse the plea of such devoted hearts, so I
will promise to keep the secret for a while; but in order
that Mr. Farnham shall not hear of it, it will be best
not to let the engagement be known yet to any one else
beside the few who are in the secret. Let it be kept especially
from the servants, who may be paid spies in
their master's employ."</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney had tried to make all the servants believe
that Dorian was engaged to Azalea, and she felt
she could not bear their silent amusement when the
truth came out.</p>

<p>"Do you not agree with me?" she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes, and a thousand thanks for your goodness!" cried
Nita gratefully.</p>

<p>But Dorian looked profoundly disappointed.</p>

<p>"I should have liked to communicate with Mr. Farnham
and have my happiness assured at once," he said.
"But I waive my preference for a time in deference to
my liege-lady."</p>

<p>And he bowed to Nita with the grace of a prince.</p>

<p>"And, now," added Mrs. Courtney, with an amiability
she was far from feeling, "you two may perhaps like
to be alone a little while, so I will ask to be excused."</p>

<p>And laughing lightly, she glided away, eager to seek
her daughter whom she expected to find in hysterics up-stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>Dorian knelt almost reverently before Nita, and lifted
her cold little hand to his lips.</p>

<p>"God bless you, my own true love! May you never
repent that you gave yourself to me!" he cried fervently.</p>

<p>For answer, Nita suddenly lifted her drooping form,
and threw herself with passionate abandon into his eager
arms, clasping his neck and hiding her face on his shoulder,
sobbing and shuddering in an alarming, hysterical
fashion.</p>

<p>Dorian embraced her tenderly, and at length kissed
away her tears, leading her to a seat by the window,
where the cool sea-breeze fanned her heated brow and
cheeks. He did not dream that golden-haired Azalea
was crouching stealthily in the thick shrubberies outside,
and listening eagerly to their words.</p>

<p>"My darling, you must not be frightened at Donald
Kayne's threats. He shall pay dearly for his insolence
to you," he said, with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, do not harm him, for I forgive him," cried Nita
eagerly. "I am sorry for him, too; I would give worlds
to tell him the secret he wishes to know, only I cannot&mdash;dare
not," and she shuddered wildly.</p>

<p>"It seemed strange that you would not grant his
wish," Dorian exclaimed uneasily; and she sighed.</p>

<p>"There are many strange things about me, Dorian,
and I fear you will some day repent that you ever loved
me."</p>

<p>"Never!" he replied, with a passionate kiss that made
the listening Azalea tremble with jealous wrath.</p>

<p>"But," he continued tenderly, "I wish you would allow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
me to get your guardian's consent at once to our
engagement. Only think, my darling, how pleasant it
would be to be married very soon, and go abroad in this
lovely summer weather on our wedding-tour."</p>

<p>"Married! Married!" cried Nita, quailing as from a
blow. "Oh, we mustn't think of that yet, Dorian&mdash;we
mustn't, indeed. My guardian would never permit it.
I will tell you the truth. He has other views for me. I
believe he would kill me before he would permit me
to marry you."</p>

<p>"Then we will elope, and forestall his refusal."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, no, my dearest! We cannot do that. Oh,
Dorian, do not be in such a frightful hurry to marry me.
I will not listen to such a thing for a whole year! We
must just love each other and be very, very patient for
a year, and&mdash;then&mdash;we will talk about marriage," Nita
cried tremblingly, and with pallid lips.</p>

<p>The listening Azalea smiled, incredulously at Nita's
protests, and murmured:</p>

<p>"She is pretending to be coy, the coquette. But it is
not true that she is in no hurry to marry him. She will
doubtless elope with him in a week. But why does she
put such stress on a year&mdash;a whole year?" and the words
sunk deep in Azalea's memory to be recalled in fateful
after days.</p>

<p>It was crowded with the elements of tragedy and
despair, the love-story of Nita! And while struggling
desperately for just a little happiness, she was forging
the fetters of a cruel fate. Weak and loving, she said
to herself:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>"What can it matter if I love him just a little while?
A few loving words and kisses, that will be all my sin,
and it seems to me that even the angels might pity me
for so small a wrong. I am cheating Miser Farnham of
nothing, for I shall never be his wife in reality. When
the day comes for him to claim me, I shall be lying dead.
His offer only put off my death one year longer."</p>

<p>And kneeling by her bed that night, Nita innocently
thanked God for Dorian's love, and prayed that she
might have just a few months of happiness.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<h3>TWO PISTOL SHOTS.</h3>


<p>Before retiring, Dorian had written a letter to a friend
in New York asking him to come down to Pirate Beach
to see him. He hoped to be strong enough in a few days
to go out, and with his heart on fire at the angry words
Donald Kayne had rashly spoken to Nita, he was resolved
on sending Kayne a challenge to a duel.</p>

<p>In the meantime, his perplexed thoughts ran constantly
on Nita, the wonderful serpent-ring, Kayne's interest
in it, and the young girl's mysterious refusal to
explain how it came into her possession, and last, but
not least, he was full of wonder at Nita's assertion that
Miser Farnham would sooner kill her than permit her
to marry him.</p>

<p>"That is very, very strange," mused Dorian. "Why
should he object to me for Nita's husband? He lives
in New York, and he must certainly know that I am
considered an unexceptionable parti. I certainly shall
not give up Nita if I have to elope with her, and thus
defy her crusty old guardian."</p>

<p>It was strange how this new love had struck its vigorous
roots deep down into Dorian's nature. Some loves
he had had before, but they had burned themselves out
in brief flirtations, and he had grown to distrust the sex.
Then all at once he had come to a new era in life.</p>

<p>In the very depths of his soul Dorian felt that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
was a resistless passion sweeping him before it like a
feather on the waves.</p>

<p>Several days passed away very quietly and uneventfully&mdash;the
quiet that precedes the storm. To the surprise
and relief of the lovers no effort was made by the Courtneys
to hinder the course of their true love. Azalea
raved in secret, and smiled in public. Through Donald
Kayne she hoped to avenge her fancied wrongs on both.</p>

<p>One day while lingering in the grounds with Nita,
Dorian told her simply the story of his acquaintance with
Azalea.</p>

<p>"We were once engaged," he said frankly, "and at the
time she was rich. Not that I cared for that, but I always
had an ardent desire to be loved for myself alone,
and a dread of being married for my money. So I laid
a clever plan to test Azalea's affection for me. I made
her believe that I lost all my fortune by the failure of a
bank. In reality I had lost only a few thousands, but
that served my purpose, and the scheming Azalea immediately
broke off with me, declaring that she could
not marry a poor man. When I was gone she discovered
the truth, and tried to win me back, but I had found out
that I did not really love her after all, and I was too
happy over my escape to be coaxed into her toils again.
Soon after they lost all their wealth, and dropped out
of society, and I never saw them again until I came to
Pirate Beach. Azalea is a regular little cat, purring
and deceitful, and I know now that I never really loved
her, or I should not have been so anxious to put her to
the test, or so glad when she proved faithless."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>Nita did not tell him that Azalea had told her that she
had made up her quarrel with Dorian; she felt that the
disappointed girl had already sunk low enough in the
eyes of her old lover.</p>

<p>She felt herself, too, as guilty as Azalea, for was
she not deceiving Dorian herself?&mdash;deceiving him because
she loved him so dearly, and could not deny herself
the happiness within her reach.</p>

<p>"Although I can never marry him I want him to love
me," she thought.</p>

<p>A week had passed. Dorian, growing impatient at
the strange silence of the friend in New York to whom
he had written, resolved to go to the city and see him.</p>

<p>At parting with Nita he begged her again to let him
speak to her guardian at once. And again she became
frightened at the bare idea, and tearfully refused her
consent. Grieved and disappointed, he went away.</p>

<p>Nita was sad and lonely when Dorian had gone. She
took to walking and boating with the faithful Lizette as
her attendant, and the rich, warm air soon blew a lovely
rose-tint into her pale cheeks, and a new sparkle into
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Miss Nita, you have been getting prettier and prettier
every day since I first saw you. It's no wonder Mr.
Mountcastle is so much in love with you," cried the
faithful maid, who, although she had not been told of the
engagement, comprehended very well how matters stood.</p>

<p>"Hush, Lizette! Do you not know that Miss Courtney
says that he is engaged to her?" replied Nita demurely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"It isn't true, miss, and nobody believes her, for it's
perfectly plain that he adores the ground you walk on;
and who could blame him?" answered Lizette loyally.</p>

<p>The third day brought Nita a long love-letter from
Dorian. When she had read and reread it many times,
she blushingly kissed it, and hid it in her bosom. The
next morning she said to Lizette:</p>

<p>"I have a secret. Mr. Mountcastle is coming back to-morrow
evening. He is coming in his own yacht from
New York, and he wants you and me, Lizette, to meet
him on the beach, and take a moonlight trip&mdash;no one
else to know it. Do you think it would be very wrong,
Lizette?"</p>

<p>"Not with me along to take care of you, miss," promptly
answered Lizette, who at twenty-five felt herself quite
a mature person.</p>

<p>"Then we will go," cried Nita joyfully, thinking how
romantic it would be to have a little moonlight sail with
Dorian on his yacht. And there was nothing wrong
about it with her maid for a companion, she thought.</p>

<p>She and Lizette slipped out at sunset the next evening,
and as there was some time to wait they strolled along the
beach toward old Meg's picturesque cabin, and suddenly
came upon the old hag loitering idly along.</p>

<p>She scowled angrily when she saw the mistress and
maid, and Nita bade Lizette drop back out of hearing.</p>

<p>"I wish to have a little private talk with old Meg,"
she exclaimed, and the fortune-teller said gruffly:</p>

<p>"I want nothing to say to you."</p>

<p>"No matter&mdash;I have business with you. Is it really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
true, Meg, what you told me that night when I made
Lizette spare you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is true."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for it. I cannot see why Heaven ever
chose to afflict me so cruelly. You cannot blame me for
being sorry. Why, you are the most wicked old woman
I ever saw. Are you not afraid that Mr. Mountcastle
will have you punished for your attempt at robbery and
murder that night?"</p>

<p>The hag broke into a torrent of curses and denials, but
the listener said scornfully:</p>

<p>"He is certain it was you, although, at my request, he
has not betrayed your attempt upon his life, but suffered
people to think it was an unknown assailant."</p>

<p>"It would have been better if you had not saved him,
Nita&mdash;far better," exclaimed the old woman, with sudden
solemnity, and, falling into abject whining, she continued
wheedingly:</p>

<p>"I did it out of kindness to him, Nita. He was on his
way to Gray Gables, and I read in the stars that fate
lowered over him there&mdash;a fate worse than death. I tried
to spare him, but you saved him&mdash;saved him to repent it,
maybe, till the last hour of your life! There is a strange
doom hanging over you, Nita; I saw it in the stars last
night, but I could not read it very clearly, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Nita, it is time. Come," called Lizette shrilly,
and, nodding to the old hag, Nita ran breathlessly away
to watch for Dorian's yacht.</p>

<p>A boat brought Dorian ashore from the beautiful yacht
that was already rechristened <i>Nita</i>, and he ran joyfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
to greet his betrothed, sorry that Lizette was looking,
and he could not steal a kiss.</p>

<p>He pressed her hand very tightly, however, and there
was such a tender kiss in his eyes as they looked deep
into hers that she blushed and dimpled exquisitely.</p>

<p>It was twilight now, and Dorian assisted her and
Lizette into the boat and rowed them over to the yacht
that was anchored as near as possible to the shore.</p>

<p>Nita felt a strange, tremulous thrill sweep over her&mdash;was
it ecstasy or a premonition of evil?</p>

<p>Two gentlemen were standing on the deck of the
yacht, and when they were safely on board Dorian introduced
them to Nita as New York friends&mdash;Captain Van
Hise and Mr. Irwin. They gazed in deepest admiration
at the young girl's brilliant beauty, and, after a few moments'
pleasant chatting, Captain Van Hise looked significantly
at Dorian and observed:</p>

<p>"If you will set me ashore here, Mountcastle, I shall be
infinitely obliged to you."</p>

<p>"With pleasure," the young man replied, and suddenly
drew Nita away from them all into the little cabin.</p>

<p>"I must leave you for a few minutes just to set my
friend ashore. You will not mind waiting, will you, darling?"
he asked, as he drew her to his breast and kissed
her fondly.</p>

<p>"It is strange you did not bring him ashore when
you came for me," she answered.</p>

<p>"You see he had not asked me then. The presence of
women on board may have driven him to sudden desperation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
as it did me once upon a time," he replied mischievously.</p>

<p>"Oh, I do not wish to alarm your friend. Let me
return," she murmured, clinging to him.</p>

<p>"No, no, my darling, forgive my foolish jest!" he
cried, and strained her to him with a solemn, yearning
passion.</p>

<p>Blushing warmly, she escaped from his lingering caresses,
and then he led her back on deck.</p>

<p>"Mr. Irwin will amuse you while you are waiting for
me," he said, and then shook hands with the gentleman
ere he climbed down the yacht's side to the little boat.</p>

<p>Captain Van Hise was carrying a black leather case,
and he was very cheerful&mdash;two facts that would have impressed
an initiated person. The two young women suspected
nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. Irwin did not look especially attractive to a young
girl's eyes. He was more than middle-aged, and his
attire had a clerical cut in keeping with his formal gray
whiskers. His voice, when he essayed a remark, was
nervous, and the slight attempt at conversation fell
through soon, for a sudden shadow had fallen over Nita.</p>

<p>In a few minutes she became very restless, and
strained her eyes through the deep purple haze of twilight
toward the shore.</p>

<p>"It is time for Dorian to return, but I do not hear the
oars yet," she ventured tremulously.</p>

<p>At that moment there came across the water the sound
of pistol-shots from the shore!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>Nita and Lizette both shrieked simultaneously, and
sprung to their feet. Mr. Irwin also arose in alarm.</p>

<p>Nita caught his arm in a convulsive grasp.</p>

<p>"Oh, what is it? I am so frightened!" she shuddered,
and just then the sound came again&mdash;two pistol-shots
across the water.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<h3>A DUEL ON THE BEACH.</h3>


<p>Mr. Irwin was a nervous, timid man, and the two
women clinging to him alarmed him almost as much as
did the mysterious shots from the shore. He saw the
captain of the yacht hovering near, and beckoned him
frantically to his assistance. The jolly sailor approached
and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Ladies, ladies, you need not feel the least alarm. It's
only somebody shooting seagulls."</p>

<p>This plausible excuse had an instant effect on the
mistress and maid. They released the trembling Irwin,
and Nita blushingly apologized for her extreme nervousness.
In a few minutes more the captain observed:</p>

<p>"I hear the dip of the oars. Mr. Mountcastle is
returning."</p>

<p>And so it proved. But, alas, for Nita, Dorian was not
returning as he went. He lay prostrate in the bottom of
the boat, an attentive surgeon bending over him, while
Van Hise plied the oars with ease and skill.</p>

<p>The yacht captain, who had been straining his eyes
across the rapidly darkening water, turned and whispered
to Lizette:</p>

<p>"You had better take your mistress into the cabin now,
for there has been a duel over there between Mr. Kayne
and Mr. Mountcastle, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>But he never finished the sentence, for Nita's quick
ears had overheard, and she fell upon the deck with a
shriek of despair.</p>

<p>"Dorian is dead!"</p>

<p>But Dorian was not dead, although severely wounded.
It was Donald Kayne who lay upon the shore stiff and
stark, slain by his friend for a woman's sake.</p>

<p>The accursed serpent ring had already borne ghastly
fruit, just as the chuckling old miser had foreseen when
he forced Nita to wear it as the price of life and liberty.</p>

<p>"A most deplorable affair," Captain Van Hise said
later, when telling the horrified Irwin about it. "You
see, Kayne had said something reflecting on the lady
Dorian is to marry, and so he challenged him. I was his
second, and Kayne came down with his own second and
the two surgeons on his own yacht, so both principals
were ready for instant flight if the authorities got wind
of the duel. Kayne's yacht is at the regular landing, half
a mile from here, and my friend came to this point to
take up the lady, and also to be handy to the dueling-ground
over yonder. Well, it was a gallant affair.
They fought at ten paces with navy revolvers. Both
escaped the first fire, but at the second, Donald Kayne
fell dead and Dorian severely wounded. And, sure
enough, the authorities were down on us. We just barely
got our man into the boat and pulled out before they galloped
on horseback to the meeting-place, and hallooed
after our party."</p>

<p>Mr. Irwin was startled, distressed, indignant.</p>

<p>"This is most outrageous!" he exclaimed. "I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
been grossly deceived by your friend. He employed me
to perform a marriage ceremony, not to attend him to a
dueling-ground."</p>

<p>"The marriage all in good time, reverend sir. The
duel was merely an episode by the way," returned Captain
Van Hise airily.</p>

<p>"But I shall be mixed up in this notorious affair. It
will do me incalculable injury. I demand to be set
ashore at once," groaned the timorous preacher.</p>

<p>"Impossible, my dear sir, dearly as I would love to
oblige you. The yacht is already under way escaping
pursuit. Besides, you may be needed presently to soothe
the last hours of a dying sinner, which is even more important
than the tying of a matrimonial knot, I take it;
so be tranquil, please. No harm shall come to you from
this."</p>

<p>The clergyman saw that all remonstrances were useless;
he must accept the situation.</p>

<p>"And you believe that Mr. Mountcastle will die?"
he asked in a tone of awe.</p>

<p>"Can't say, but hope not. The doctor is dressing his
wound now&mdash;shoulder&mdash;ball went clean through. Poor
fellow's having hard luck lately! Stabbed and left for
dead on the beach three weeks ago, and barely out of
bed when he came to New York to challenge Kayne.
Yes, dismal affair, very, but couldn't be helped, you
know."</p>

<p>The half-crazed Nita had already been told part of
the truth by Captain Van Hise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Donald Kayne was mortally wounded, we fear," was
the way he put it about Dorian's opponent.</p>

<p>She lay weeping bitterly in the cabin attended by
faithful Lizette. The surgeon would not let her see
Dorian yet in spite of her prayers.</p>

<p>"The wound is not necessarily dangerous, but he is
weak from loss of blood, and so agitated that he cannot
bear any excitement," he said.</p>

<p>But when the wound was dressed, and he was resting
easily, he was permitted a few minutes' conversation
with Captain Van Hise. Then the jolly soldier said ruefully:</p>

<p>"I can't refuse you, Dorian, since the surgeon won't
let you talk for yourself, but, by Jupiter, I'd rather face
the enemy's guns any day than that girl with this story!
What a cheek you must have had to plan such a thing!"</p>

<p>"She will forgive me even if she refuses to grant my
prayer," answered Dorian, for he knew women better
than the gallant captain, who had wooed the goddess of
war more assiduously than the goddess of love.</p>

<p>So it came to pass that while the yacht <i>Nita</i> skimmed
lightly over the moon-lighted waters, Captain Van
Hise sat in the cabin with her namesake, floundering
through a story that would, he fully believed, enrage
her so that she would never, never marry Dorian, and,
more than likely, would never even forgive him.</p>

<p>"He is so weak and nervous, Miss Farnham, the surgeon
won't let him do his own talking, so, as I've been
his confidant in the whole affair, he has sent me to tell
you&mdash;to tell you&mdash;&mdash;" The doughty warrior broke down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
and mopped his damp brow, murmuring under his
breath:</p>

<p>"Blamed if I don't wish myself well out of this!"</p>

<p>"To tell me&mdash;&mdash;" echoed Nita, with heart-piercing
anxiety. And thus encouraged, he returned to the
charge:</p>

<p>"You'll understand it all better, my dear young lady,
when I tell you that Dorian has always been a spoiled
boy&mdash;had everything he wanted all his life&mdash;cousin of
mine, known him from boyhood&mdash;so, of course, he was
frantic when you vowed you wouldn't marry him for a
whole year&mdash;eternity, you know, to a man in love.
Don't blame me, please! but as soon as the details of
the duel was arranged, Dorian planned to elope with
you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Heaven!" cried Nita, in wildest alarm, and her
face became ashen.</p>

<p>"Don't excite yourself&mdash;please don't, Miss Farnham,"
cried the soldier anxiously. "Or at least let me get
through first, then rave if you will."</p>

<p>Lizette moved nearer to her young lady's side in mute
distress, and he went on eagerly:</p>

<p>"Didn't you think it strange, Dorian's inviting you to
go yachting with him by moonlight? Bless you! he
brought along a preacher&mdash;Irwin, you know&mdash;to marry
you to-night; that is, of course, if you were willing&mdash;no
gentleman would want to marry a lady without her consent.
You see, he didn't expect to get wounded in the
duel, and&mdash;oh, a mere episode that&mdash;and so, if you'll
excuse my bluntness&mdash;here we are at sea, afraid to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
back because the authorities are after us about the duel,
and it might be best to stay away till the excitement
blows over. And Dorian is wounded, and maybe you
would think it real romantic to nurse him. Now would
you be willing&mdash;so Dorian sent me to ask you&mdash;to marry
him now!"</p>

<p>He drew breath and looked at her apprehensively.
Lizette had uttered a smothered little shriek, but Nita sat
speechless and terrified, as if she had seen a ghost. All
in a moment the enormity of her folly and her sin rushed
over her.</p>

<p>Oh, why had she let him love her? Why had she, in
her weakness, drifted into this sea of difficulty. She
gasped for breath; she felt like one drowning; and the
doughty captain murmured cajolingly:</p>

<p>"Although Dorian has acted very impetuously, and you
have a perfect right to be angry, still I know the poor
boy would be dreadfully broken up if you refused his
prayer. And Irwin, too&mdash;poor fellow!&mdash;he did not know
how dreadfully uncertain the affair was, and would be so
very much disappointed."</p>

<p>"This is cruel, cruel!" Nita murmured. "I told Dorian
my&mdash;my&mdash;guardian&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, Miss Farnham; but the impulsive boy
thought it would be great fun to outwit your crusty old
guardian. You weren't fond of him, anyway, were
you?"&mdash;anxiously.</p>

<p>She began to murmur something about duty and obedience,
but he broke in, almost curtly:</p>

<p>"You owe him neither now, my dear young lady. Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
how can I tell you? Only, I don't suppose you ever
cared much for the&mdash;ahem!&mdash;disreputable old party&mdash;miser,
and all that&mdash;but the truth is, there was an accident
on the elevated road to-day, and Charles Farnham
was badly injured and taken to the hospital. Just before
we left New York we got news of his death."</p>

<h3>"WITH THIS RING I THEE WED."</h3>


<p>"You have killed my mistress!" cried the maid angrily.</p>

<p>Nita had fallen unconscious at his feet.</p>

<p>"It is only a faint," he replied.</p>

<p>And between them she was soon restored to consciousness,
although still dazed and white and trembling from
the shock she had received.</p>

<p>Miser Farnham dead! She could scarcely realize it,
and she tried hard to keep from feeling glad and happy
over the startling news. It seemed cruel and wicked to
rejoice over any one's death.</p>

<p>Captain Van Hise returned to the charge as soon as he
thought she could bear it.</p>

<p>"Of course, if Dorian could have foreseen this he
would not have planned to carry you off," he said. "But
as things have fallen out, don't you think you had better
forgive him and marry him to-night?"</p>

<p>"You are perfectly certain that Mr. Farnham is dead?"
she asked him, with such shuddering anxiety that he
knew how all depended on his answer, and hastened to
reply:</p>

<p>"Perfectly certain. We had it from the best authority."</p>

<p>This was a white lie, but he considered it admissible in
his friend's behalf. He had only heard the current
rumor, but he did not suppose that the old man's death
had any special bearing on Nita's marriage to Dorian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
except that it seemed to him a very desirable thing that
the objectionable guardian had been removed so opportunely
from this mundane sphere.</p>

<p>"Not a very desirable connection for a lady in the position
that Mrs. Dorian Mountcastle will occupy, for everybody
in New York had heard of Miser Farnham, and his
record was not a straight one," he mused, and thought he
saw relenting in Nita's eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, come with me to Dorian," he urged. "The surgeon
has agreed to a brief interview, only you must be
very calm and not excite him."</p>

<p>Lizette who, for a maid, was a very superior sort of
person, beamed cordial approval.</p>

<p>"Miss Nita, I think the easiest way is to consent!" she
cried. "If you refuse it may make him worse, and since
you intend to marry him some time, anyway, what's the
odds?"</p>

<p>"Yes, what's the odds?" echoed Van Hise cheerfully,
and led her to Dorian.</p>

<p>She wondered in a dazed way if she ought to tell her
lover the truth&mdash;tell him she had been married to the
repulsive old miser, but her whole soul rose in rebellion
against the humiliating confession.</p>

<p>She remembered how he had scorned Azalea because
she would have married him for his money. No&mdash;no, he
would despise her if he knew&mdash;he who had never known
poverty and hunger and bitter need&mdash;that she had sold
herself to the horrible old miser for a chest of gold.</p>

<p>When she saw Dorian lying in the berth so wan and
pale, wounded in a chivalrous defense of her, she forgot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
everything else but that she loved him wildly&mdash;madly!
Loved him with a love that was her doom.</p>

<p>Quite overcome, she sank upon her knees by Dorian's
berth.</p>

<p>"Oh, my love, my love," she whispered, with her lips
against his brow.</p>

<p>And then Dorian knew that the victory was won. If
she had wavered for one moment his pale, handsome,
suffering face had turned the scale in his favor.</p>

<p>And her dark eyes answered without words.</p>

<p>"You are an angel," he murmured. "Oh, Nita, I will
pay you for this with a life's devotion. But I should
have died of my wound, I think, very soon if you had
said you would not marry me!"</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Farnham, permit me," said Captain
Van Hise at this juncture.</p>

<p>He raised her gently, and placed her in a seat by
Dorian.</p>

<p>"You were not to have much excitement, you know,
Dorian, so let us have the agony over as soon as possible,"
he remarked genially.</p>

<p>And though Nita's heart leaped in sweet alarm, he
gave her no respite, but went and brought the preacher,
the surgeon, the captain, and Lizette.</p>

<p>Propped up by the surgeon's arm, Dorian held Nita's
cold little hand in his, and a few solemn words made her
his bride.</p>

<p>"'To have and to hold from this day forward,'" went
on Irwin's solemn voice.</p>

<p>And directly the ring was slipped over Nita's third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
finger, and she was bending her stately head for her husband's
kiss. Then they all congratulated the pair very
quietly and retired, the surgeon lingering to give Dorian
a sedative, after which he said gravely:</p>

<p>"Now, Mrs. Mountcastle, you may sit by your husband
until he falls asleep, but no talking, remember, for
he must have a long night's rest."</p>

<p>They were alone together. He looked up at her in
grateful, adoring love.</p>

<p>"We are on our wedding-trip, darling," he murmured.</p>

<p>"Yes, Dorian. Now sleep," she whispered, as she
placed her hand caressingly on his white brow. He
closed his eyes, and the beautiful bride sat and watched
him, her heart thrilling with passionate love and joy.</p>

<p>"He is mine&mdash;all mine&mdash;my darling husband!" she
thought, with a thrill of thanksgiving that she had been
turned aside that day in the park from the fell purpose
of self-destruction. "It is always darkest just before
dawn, and thus it was with me," she whispered in blissful
unconsciousness of the lowering future.</p>

<p>By and by Lizette came to lead her away, and much
as she would have preferred to remain by Dorian, she
felt that the surgeon would be better pleased if she left
him.</p>

<p>The sky was cloudy and the sea rough. Mr. Irwin
and Captain Van Hise had succumbed to sea-sickness
and were invisible. The captain of the yacht was busy,
and the surgeon, after a few pleasant words, went down
to watch over his patient.</p>

<p>"Miss Nita, dear, don't let's stay on deck. Seems like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
it's getting colder, and the wind is so high and the
waves so rough they break over the deck. You'll get
splashed all over if you don't come into the cabin."</p>

<p>"Not yet, Lizette, for I love old ocean in all his moods,
and this is sublime. How the wind roars, and how fast
the dark, ragged clouds drift over the moon, showing
silver edges now and then, again all inky black. Isn't it
grand?"</p>

<p>"It just frightens me so that I can't see anything
pretty about it. Oh, dear, Miss Nita, ain't you afraid
of the mountain waves rolling so fast? Seems like one
of them will go right over the yacht presently, and bury
us in the bottom of the sea."</p>

<p>Lizette shivered with fear, but Nita answered
smilingly:</p>

<p>"No, I am not afraid, but, still I think we are going to
have a little bit of a storm. Ah! did you see that lightning
flash? Hark the thunder!"</p>

<p>Then the rain began to patter upon the deck, and both
ran into the cabin, breathless with the wind and cool air,
the maid lamenting:</p>

<p>"Oh, why did we come, why did we come? The yacht
will be wrecked. We shall all be drowned!"</p>

<p>Nita tried to encourage the frightened creature, but
all in vain, for the torrents of falling rain and the boom
of the waves produced so much noise that they could not
distinguish each other's voices.</p>

<p>"Oh, what shall we do? what shall we do?" shrieked
the frightened maid, half-crazed with alarm. "I'll go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
the captain this minute and beg him to take us back
home."</p>

<p>Half-crazed by fear, she ran shrieking out upon the
deck, and, at a sudden lurch of the yacht, fell prostrate.
Nita followed, and stooped to help her to rise. What
followed was told afterward with a white face of horror
by the yacht captain who, just coming to seek them, became
an eye-witness of a terrible tragedy, and himself
narrowly escaped becoming a victim.</p>

<p>The night was inky-black, only for the fitful lightning
flashes; the wind violent; the rain pouring in torrents,
and he began to feel alarmed himself for the safety of the
yacht and its passengers.</p>

<p>As Irwin and Van Hise were both suffering the
agonies of sea-sickness, he thought of the two solitary
women who might be frightened, and started to speak a
word of comfort to them.</p>

<p>Staggering over the rocking deck toward the light that
flickered from the cabin door, he beheld Lizette rush out
shrieking with fear.</p>

<p>The yacht dipped down into the trough of a sea, and
the maid lost her footing and fell prostrate. The next
instant a blinding electric flash showed him Nita clinging
to and trying to lift Lizette; then the bow of the yacht
dipped lower still and the curving billow rose up high
in air; then it broke over the deck in a fury and flung
the man prostrate upon his face. He clutched at something&mdash;he
never knew what&mdash;and the mighty mass of
water swept over him.</p>

<p>The yacht bounded upward again, and&mdash;but for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
man clinging and gasping for dear life&mdash;the deck was
swept bare.</p>

<p>On the wings of the sobbing gale came to him shrieks
of despair from the two doomed women swept off into
the sea.</p>

<p>A few minutes longer the storm raged wildly, then as
if the elements had wreaked their fury, the sea grew
calmer, the winds lulled, the rain ceased, the black
clouds parted above, and silvery moon-rays fringed the
rents with heavenly glory.</p>

<p>But to the little knot of men huddled upon the deck
of the <i>Nita</i> watching the sea with agonized eyes came
no sight of the lost ones&mdash;the fair bride and the faithful
maid&mdash;who had been engulfed in the mighty mass of
foaming waters.</p>

<p>They looked at each other with ashen faces, these sorrowful
men; they spoke in despairing voices; they were
wounded to the heart by this awful tragedy.</p>

<p>And the burden of their cry was that it would kill
Dorian to learn the tragic fate of his bride.</p>

<p>"He must not know," said Doctor Ray, the surgeon.
"Through all the tumult of the storm he has slept peacefully
under the influence of a sedative, and it is likely he
will rest quietly until morning. When he asks for his
bride he must be told that she is ill of sea-sickness, with
her maid in close attendance. This excuse must serve
until he is convalescent. Let no man forget, for whoever
should tell him the truth would be guilty of murder."</p>

<p>No one doubted it, and they acquiesced in his decision.
So the long night passed, and the summer morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
dawned with the balmy air and cloudless skies, but
Dorian, when he waked, was feverish and out of his head.</p>

<p>They did not have to make any excuses to him about
the lost one. In his delirium he seemed to forget her
existence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the week that followed upon her compact with
Donald Kayne, Azalea Courtney had not been able to
gain a single clue to the mystery of Nita's possession of
the serpent ring. She had duly communicated to him the
conversation she had overheard that night between the
lovers, but neither one could make anything out of Nita's
words, except the natural agitation of a young girl who
knows certainly that her guardian will disapprove of her
heart's choice.</p>

<p>The week that followed, before Dorian went up to
New York, was one of secret, silent, but exquisite torture
to the baffled Azalea. Her plans and schemes for bringing
about a misunderstanding between the lovers, and
winning Dorian for herself, had failed utterly.</p>

<p>Dorian was so nearly well that he would not permit
himself to be treated as an invalid. He took his meals
with them in the dining-room; he spent his evenings in
the drawing-room, and, although he listened to Azalea's
songs and politely turned the pages of her music, she
knew that she bored him inexpressibly, and that he was
always glad to escape to his betrothed at the window,
where she always sat, after turning her beautiful, grave
face from them all, to gaze at the sea, and listen to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
solemn tone, that was so much sweeter to her ears than
Azalea's voice.</p>

<p>When Dorian turned from the piano, and went back
to his love at the window, Azalea's heart would swell
with jealous wrath until her voice would falter almost
into silence, and the greatest aim of her life grew to be
revenge upon Nita, who had won the prize she had
worked for in vain.</p>

<p>Those golden summer days, while Dorian and Nita
loitered in the old garden, laughing and pelting each
other with roses like two gleeful children, or read poetry
to each other in the honeysuckle bowers, Azalea could
hardly bear her life, but she smiled on, like the Spartan
boy, sure that, somehow or other, with Donald Kayne's
assistance, she would find a way to torture the proud
and happy lovers.</p>

<p>At last the end of the week and the love-making came,
for Dorian went up to New York on that mission that
was to prove so disastrous to all concerned.</p>

<p>And Nita, left alone with the two hostile women who
barely masked their antagonism to her under a thin
veneer of courtesy, relapsed into a profound melancholy.
With Dorian by her side she could almost forget the
dark shadow that clouded all her future with the blackness
of despair.</p>

<p>Their mutual love, so strong, so pure, had the talismanic
power to ward off evil and disquieting thoughts,
but with Dorian away, Nita was haunted by vexing fears
that would not down. Soon came the letter inviting Nita
and her maid for the moonlight trip upon the yacht.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>When Azalea saw her rival's flushed and happy face
she grew almost frantic with secret rage. A longing
seized upon her to know what Dorian had written in the
letter that had brought back the fading roses to Nita's
cheeks, and that light of gladness to her dark eyes.</p>

<p>When Nita and her maid went down to the shore at
sunset Azalea stole up to the girl's room, determined to
search for Dorian's letter. Nita had placed the precious
missive in a silver jewel-case on her dressing-table, and,
after a short search, Azalea found it, and flew to her
mother with flaming cheeks.</p>

<p>"Read this," she panted breathlessly. "Oh, mama, all
is lost! They are going to elope, I am sure!"</p>

<p>When Mrs. Courtney had read the letter she agreed
with her daughter. Dorian and Nita had certainly
planned an elopement.</p>

<p>"Oh, mama, you must not permit it! You can certainly
assume that much authority! Come, come, let us
go down to the beach and force her to return with us,"
cried the excited Azalea, and, carried away by her impetuosity,
Mrs. Courtney obeyed.</p>

<p>But they were just a little late for the execution of
their designs. Azalea was doomed to disappointment.
Nita was already on board the yacht with her maid, and
while yet at some little distance from the scene they became
the startled witnesses of the duel fought upon the
beach by the two enemies in the purple light of the
gloaming with the sound of the solemn sea in their heedless
ears.</p>

<p>With shrieks of fear Azalea flew toward the scene, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
too late to interrupt the duelists. Captain Van Hise was
already pushing off from shore the little boat with Dorian
and the surgeon, and the officers of the law were surrounding
the other group upon the shore, where Donald
Kayne lay stretched out upon the silvery sands.</p>

<p>Upon the confused group Azalea broke with hysterical
shrieks and cries, and soon all that she knew was told;
Mrs. Courtney, coming up as soon as she could follow
her lighter-footed daughter, confirmed the story of the
elopement. To-morrow that and the duel would startle
the world at large.</p>

<p>The officers of the law agreed that Donald Kayne
should be taken back to New York on his own yacht, and
then the group dispersed, Mrs. Courtney leading the hysterical
Azalea back to Gray Gables, where she spent a
wakeful night with her daughter, who actually threatened
to commit suicide because Dorian had carried off Nita
to make her his bride. But by morning Azalea was able
to discuss the situation, and she agreed that it looked very
discouraging for her mother.</p>

<p>"Mr. Farnham will be furiously angry with me for letting
it happen, and I have no doubt that as soon as he
reads it in the papers he will come down here to turn me
out of the house," Mrs. Courtney complained bitterly,
for this luxurious home was a palace compared to the
humble lodgings in the city where she would be forced
to return when she lost her well-paid position as chaperon
to Miser Farnham's heiress.</p>

<p>"But, mama, you must, of course, insist upon receiving
the whole year's salary," cried Azalea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course," replied her mother, and took up the
morning paper, adjusted her glasses, and began to read.</p>

<p>"Is there anything about the duel?" eagerly inquired
Azalea, from the couch, where she was enacting the part
of a semi-invalid.</p>

<p>"No, nothing yet. Too soon, you know, Azalea; but,
of course, all the evening papers will have it. Oh, good
gracious, what is this! Accident yesterday afternoon
on the elevated railroad, and several people killed and
wounded. Azalea, listen to this:</p>

<p>"'Charles Farnham, very well known as a peculiar
character of New York, called the miser, was seriously
wounded, and at first reported killed, but revived a little,
and was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he now lies
in a semi-unconscious condition.'"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>

<h3>"SHALL I NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN?"</h3>


<p>"Lizette, Lizette! Oh, where am I?"</p>

<p>A weak, languid voice asked the question, while a
dark, graceful head raised itself wearily from the pillow,
and dark, solemn eyes, shining out of a waxen-white
face, stared wonderingly over at a trim figure knitting
lace at an open window. The figure gave a start, dropped
the needles and some stitches together, gave a bound
across the room and knelt down by the couch.</p>

<p>"Oh, you little darling&mdash;you little darling, you are
better, you know me," cooed Lizette, lovingly patting the
pale, delicate cheek.</p>

<p>"Lizette, of course I know you," her mistress answered
with wondering impatience. "But where am I?"</p>

<p>"In your own room, of course, Miss Nita," answered
the maid, with a certain air of evasiveness.</p>

<p>"In my own room? Why, it all looks very strange to
me! Oh, Lizette, was it all a dream? The yacht&mdash;Dorian?"
cried the girl eagerly, a warm, pink flush creeping
over the pallor of her waxen cheek.</p>

<p>"Dearie, you have been ill and your dreams were
wild," soothed Lizette. "But you must not talk now.
Wait till you take some food."</p>

<p>She went out of the little bedroom, and presently stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
face to face with a tall, dark, anxious-looking man, who
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"She has recovered consciousness&mdash;I see it in your
face!"</p>

<p>"She knows me, sir, but I have omitted nothing yet.
And you, sir, must be cautious. One sight of your face
would frighten her, I think, almost to death."</p>

<p>"I shall not intrude upon her yet, Lizette, but as soon
as she can bear it, she must know the truth," he answered
grimly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Nita lay with wide-open, wondering eyes.
For days everything had been a blank, but now memory
was returning with startling rapidity.</p>

<p>Lizette entered with a tray of delicate food.</p>

<p>"After you have eaten something you may talk a little,"
she said, and Nita ate with the relish of returning health.</p>

<p>"Lizette, do let me talk, for I am so much better," she
coaxed. "You say I have been dreaming, but," blushing
deeply, "was I not on the yacht? Was I not&mdash;married&mdash;to&mdash;Dorian?"</p>

<p>Lizette smiled a gracious assent, and then Nita said
quickly:</p>

<p>"Why, then, did you call it all a dream?"</p>

<p>"Tell me your dreams, dearie," replied the maid taking
the little hand and holding it gently in both her own.</p>

<p>"It was terrible, Lizette, if it was a dream. I thought
there was a storm at night. You were frightened, and
ran out of the cabin. You fell down, and I followed to
catch you. But a great wave like a mountain rushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
over the deck and swept us both into the sea. Lizette,
how you tremble. It is terrible even to hear of such a
dream, is it not?</p>

<p>"Oh, Lizette, how vivid it was for a dream! There
we were struggling for life in the dark, tempestuous
waves. When you fell you had caught at the rungs of
a steamer-chair, and while you clutched it, I clung to
your waist. Although I am a good swimmer, I could
not help myself in so rough a sea, and it seemed as if
death must soon be our portion&mdash;death, and it was so
cruel to die like that when I had just been wedded to my
lover. But we clung to hope, and the great waves tossed
us hither and thither like feathers away from the yacht
and toward our death, for we knew that no one had witnessed
our accident, and even had that happened we could
not have been saved in such a terrific storm."</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Nita, you will make yourself worse talking
so much!" cried Lizette nervously.</p>

<p>"But," continued Nita smilingly, "now I come to the
best part of my dream. Very suddenly&mdash;and, oh! the
gladness of that moment&mdash;the wild storm lulled, the
thunder, lightning, and rain ceased, the black clouds
parted overhead and silvery moonrays glimmered
through. I seemed to hear your voice cry out in joy;
then my nerves relaxed, my senses reeled, I seemed to
fall from a dizzy height into the darkness of death. Oh,
Lizette, how real and vivid it seems to me&mdash;those moments
or hours of deadly peril in the dark sea, yet you
say it was only a dream."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>Lizette smoothed the wavy tresses back from the girl's
brow with a trembling hand and answered gently:</p>

<p>"My dear young mistress, you seem so much better
that I will not deceive you. It was no dream&mdash;it was
terrible reality."</p>

<p>"How, Lizette? No dream? Then we were rescued
by the people on the yacht after all. Thank Heaven!
But Dorian, my Dorian, why does he not come to me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we were rescued, Miss Nita, the moment you
became unconscious. Just as the moon's ray pierced the
gloom some yachtsmen near by saw us struggling in the
water. They quickly rescued us, but the doctor on the
yacht worked over you an hour before you showed any
signs of life. Since then you have been ill and knew no
one till now."</p>

<p>"How long, Lizette?"</p>

<p>"Oh, several days, miss," evasively.</p>

<p>"And I did not even recognize Dorian! How very,
very strange. Why, Lizette, was he so ill they could not
let him come to me? And is he better now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course he is better now."</p>

<p>"Lizette, how strange your voice sounds. Is it possible&mdash;&mdash; But
no, no! do not tell me my&mdash;husband&mdash;died
of his wound, or I shall go mad with grief!"</p>

<p>"He did not die, Miss Nita."</p>

<p>"Then why does he not come to me?"</p>

<p>And Nita made a movement as if to rise, but fell back
upon the pillow exhausted.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear young lady, please calm yourself, please<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
try to bear what I have to tell you. Mr. Mountcastle is
all right&mdash;yes, indeed, I hope and believe he is all right,
but it is impossible for him to come to you just now
because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused timorously.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;&mdash;" the young bride echoed with piercing
anxiety, and then the maid blurted out with a bitter,
stifled sob:</p>

<p>"Because it wasn't your husband's yacht that rescued
us, but another man's. Oh, my dear, don't take it so to
heart, please don't. Let us be thankful we are alive, and
that some day you will be reunited to your dear husband
again."</p>

<p>There was a blank silence of such terrible despair that
it could find no outlet. Then Nita asked in a low, sad
voice:</p>

<p>"Then, Lizette, where are we now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Nita, can you bear it? The yacht that
saved us brought us to a lonely island way up here in
Fortune's Bay, hundreds of miles from New York."</p>

<p>Again there was a blank silence of sorrow and disappointment.
Nita's heart ached with the pain of this
strange separation from her husband.</p>

<p>They looked at each other, she and the faithful maid,
and Lizette tried to smile, but it was a wretched failure.
Her poor lips trembled with the effort to restrain a bursting
sob, and Nita felt instinctively that she was keeping
something back.</p>

<p>"Lizette, have you written to my husband?" Nita
asked faintly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, my dear lady."</p>

<p>"Then he will soon come for us, will he not?"</p>

<p>"I hope so."</p>

<p>"Lizette, how evasively you speak. You are hiding
something dreadful from me, is it not so?"</p>

<p>"A mere trifle, my dearie, and you must be brave and
bear it calmly when I tell you, for, of course, all will
soon come right."</p>

<p>"Go on, for Heaven's sweet sake, Lizette. I think I
can bear anything better than this awful suspense."</p>

<p>"Miss Nita, you know the gentleman that fought the
duel with your husband, and they said was mortally
wounded? It was on his yacht we came to Fortune's
Bay. His men saved us."</p>

<p>"And he is dead, poor fellow!" Nita murmured, in a
tone of profound pity and awe.</p>

<p>"No, but I wish he was," Lizette returned, with surprising
vehemence. "Oh, my dearie, they thought at
first he was killed, but, bless you, his wound was no more
than a scratch hardly, only he fainted away so dead at
first from the shock they thought he was gone. The
worst is, that he lived at all, the wicked wretch!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lizette, how can you be so unkind? I pity
Donald Kayne."</p>

<p>"Pity Donald Kayne, Miss Nita&mdash;the worst enemy you
have on earth unless it be that little cat, Azalea Courtney!"</p>

<p>"Yes, he called himself my enemy, Lizette, and yet I
pity him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're wasting your kind feelings, Miss Nita. Now
where do you suppose you are this blessed moment?"</p>

<p>"On an island in Fortune's Bay, you said, Lizette."</p>

<p>"Yes, on the loneliest island in the bay, and shut up
in a lonely old stone house far away from any but fishermen's
huts, for nobody lives here only the roughest,
poorest sort of people, and mighty few even of that
sort!"</p>

<p>"But what does it matter, Lizette, since my husband
will come soon and take us away?"</p>

<p>"Not while he thinks we are both drowned and dead."</p>

<p>"But you have written to tell him we are rescued."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have written, but I have not been able to bribe
any one to post my letter yet. Oh, my poor little darling,
don't you understand? We are prisoners!"</p>

<p>"Prisoners!" gasped the girl, horrified.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Nita, or perhaps I ought to say Mrs.
Mountcastle. Would you like it better?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for it seems to bring me nearer to my darling
husband," cried Nita, blushing warmly. Then her lip
quivered. "Oh, why does Donald Kayne hold us prisoners?"
she cried.</p>

<p>"That is very easy to answer, Mrs. Mountcastle. It
is all about that emerald ring you are wearing. He says
he will never let us go free from this house until you
confess how you come to be wearing that serpent ring."</p>

<p>Nita groaned, and looked down with loathing eyes at
the baleful jewel that hung loosely on her wasted hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lizette, how thin I have grown! I must have been
ill some time."</p>

<p>"It is two weeks since your wedding-night, and we
landed here nine or ten days ago."</p>

<p>"And Donald Kayne?"</p>

<p>"He is here with two people&mdash;an old fisherman and
his wife&mdash;our jailers. We are closely watched and
guarded, for the old people believe you are crazy. He
has told them so. But, dearie, don't lose heart. Now
that you are getting well we will watch our chances to
escape."</p>

<p>"And you know, Lizette, my husband will be searching
for us. He will be sure to come here. Love will
show him the way."</p>

<p>"You forget that he thinks you were drowned that
night, when the great waves washed us off the deck of
his yacht."</p>

<p>"Yes, I forgot," sobbed Nita, with raining tears. "Oh,
my darling, I shall never see you again!"</p>

<p>And for a few moments she wept in uncontrollable
despair. Lizette, although almost heart-broken herself,
tried to soothe her, and she began to catch at little straws
of hope.</p>

<p>"Cannot we bribe those old people to let us escape?
Oh, Lizette, I would give them my whole chest of gold
for liberty!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Alas! I have already tried them, and failed. Kayne
has them completely under his control. You will never
get free unless you tell him that secret he wants to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
know. Oh, my dear young lady, do tell him&mdash;do tell
him! for he wants to know so badly, and surely it cannot
matter to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lizette, Lizette, you do not know&mdash;you cannot
dream&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly there came to her a wild temptation. Miser
Farnham was dead. Captain Van Hise had told her so.
What if she broke the oath of silence whose keeping was
about to wreck her life? She need not fear his vengeance.</p>

<p>While these frenzied thoughts ran through Nita's
mind Lizette walked restlessly over to the window, and
leaning against the iron bars that ran across it, stared
restlessly out over the blue bay dotted with fishing-boats
and green islands.</p>

<p>Suddenly Lizette's pretty blue eyes grew bright and
alert, and she strained them eagerly over the water. A
few minutes of silence; then she bounded across the room
to Nita, who, with her face bowed down, was lost in
troubled thought. Stooping over the young girl, she
lifted her up in both arms.</p>

<p>"Can you walk across to the window if I lead you,
dear? I want to show you such a pretty sight."</p>

<p>She half-led, half-carried the weak girl, and pointed
with a shaking finger out over the blue bay.</p>

<p>"God be praised, we shall escape!" she panted joyfully.
"Look, darling, at that pretty yacht riding into
harbor at this very island. Do you see her name?&mdash;<i>Nita</i>.
Heaven has sent your husband to Fortune's
Bay!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>

<h3>"HE WILL KILL MY HUSBAND."</h3>


<p>Nita gazed with joyful eyes and a wildly throbbing
heart at the graceful yacht lightly skimming the blue
waters of the beautiful bay, as it glided into harbor at
the island. He was near her now, her own love. Surely
he would come to her rescue, for it must have been
Heaven's own guiding that had brought him to Fortune's
Bay&mdash;Heaven that had saved her from the perils of the
stormy deep, and that was still watching over her fate.</p>

<p>She thought with a shudder of the temptation that
had assailed her just now to break the oath of silence
sworn on the dead hand in the miser's gold vault. No,
no, she must not. An oath was a solemn thing, and she
had been desperate with despair, or she would not have
dreamed of breaking it.</p>

<p>And what would it avail her enemy to know the tragic
death that had befallen the woman whose fate he had
sought to know. He had loved her, he said. Would it
not break his heart to know how she had suffered and
died? Surely, it was a mercy to Donald Kayne to keep
him in uncertainty.</p>

<p>"Lizette, what if we wave our handkerchiefs from the
window? Perhaps some one on the yacht might notice
it and make inquiries," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>They spent some time at this, but of no avail, although
they could see moving figures on the deck. But no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
noticed or recognized the frantic signals from the window
of the far-off stone house.</p>

<p>"Lizette, can you make out any of the men on her
deck? My eyes are so weak, the glare of the light blinds
them," murmured Nita.</p>

<p>"No, dearie; they seem like little black specks to me.
If I had some glasses we could make them out plainly.
I'll go and ask the old woman to lend us a pair," and
Lizette hurried down-stairs on her errand.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rhodus, the fisherman's wife, looked at her with
suspicion when she made her request.</p>

<p>"What do you want with them?" she asked roughly.</p>

<p>"My mistress wants to watch the ships upon the sea."</p>

<p>"Hain't got no glasses&mdash;never had none," replied the
woman nonchalantly.</p>

<p>"Where's your husband?"</p>

<p>"Out in his boat."</p>

<p>"And Mr. Kayne?"</p>

<p>"He went for a walk just now."</p>

<p>"And is there no one here but you?"</p>

<p>"No, not a soul; but don't go for to think you can get
away from me. I'm as strong as two men; besides,
there's a big dog out in the yard that 'ud tear you both
in pieces if you went outside."</p>

<p>Lizette smiled scornfully.</p>

<p>"How could we get away, and my mistress too weak
to walk?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>While she was haranguing the woman Nita continued
to gaze eagerly toward the trim little yacht in the offing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
her heart throbbing wildly with the burning desire to
see Dorian again.</p>

<p>"He is there&mdash;there, so near me, and yet so far,
believing me dead," she sobbed. "Oh, how his heart
must be torn with anguish at the thought! How strange
and sad a fate is mine."</p>

<p>Her weak eyes, tired with the glare of the light and
sun, drooped wearily to the ground, and a cry of wonder
and dismay broke from her lips.</p>

<p>Directly beneath her window stood a large, tall man in
sailor garb gazing up into her face. But it was not the
mere proximity of the man that had so startled the young
girl. It was the fact that she had recognized in him the
son of old Meg, the fortune-teller&mdash;a man who had once
madly loved her, and from whose unwelcome love she
had fled in fear and loathing.</p>

<p>For more than three years Nita had not looked upon
the face of Jack Dineheart, and when she saw him gazing
up at her with eager eyes, she could not repress a cry of
surprise at sight of this ghost from the past.</p>

<p>Jack Dineheart had a bronzed, handsome, sullen face,
seamed with the lines of thirty-five years or more, and
his big brown eyes snapped with triumph now at the
girl's low cry of recognition.</p>

<p>"So it is you, Nita?"</p>

<p>"Yes it is I, Mr. Dineheart," answered the girl, with a
sudden wild hope that she might move his heart to pity.</p>

<p>"What are you doing up there behind bolts and bars
like a prisoner?" he continued, his heart leaping wildly
at sight of the lovely face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am a prisoner," she answered sorrowfully. "Oh,
Jack&mdash;Mr. Dineheart&mdash;do help me to escape, won't you?"</p>

<p>"But I don't understand. Who brought you here?
Who is keeping you shut up?"</p>

<p>"A New York gentleman&mdash;a Mr. Donald Kayne."</p>

<p>"Wants to marry you, I s'pose?" with an angry, jealous
frown.</p>

<p>"No, no, he hates me, but he wants to know a secret
that I hold, and he swears he will never let me go free
until I tell it; but&mdash;but I will never tell, never, not if I
die here."</p>

<p>"Must be a very important secret," commented the
sailor curiously.</p>

<p>And he saw a look of terror leap in the lovely eyes;
but she answered carelessly:</p>

<p>"No, no, it is not much, only I will not tell it. I will
tell no one. Oh, Jack Dineheart, have pity on me, and
help me to escape, and I will make you rich."</p>

<p>"A likely story. When did you come into a fortune?"
cried the sailor eagerly.</p>

<p>"No matter, but I am rich, and I will give you half my
fortune, Jack, if you will do one little errand for me. Do
you see that yacht that has just come into the harbor
yonder? Look, you can just make out her name&mdash;<i>Nita</i>.
Go there, Jack Dineheart, and tell the owner of the
yacht that I was not drowned when the storm swept me
with my maid from off the deck of the yacht. Tell him
Donald Kayne lives, and that he saved my life and
Lizette's, and that he is keeping us in prison here until I
reveal a secret. Oh, go, go, go, I pray you, and do this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
errand, and my prison doors will fly open, and you shall
be made rich, while my blessings shall follow you throughout
your whole life."</p>

<p>She paused, panting and exhausted, her small upraised
hands clasped in pathetic pleading. Jack Dineheart
looked up at her with sullen curiosity.</p>

<p>"This man who is to open your prison doors&mdash;the
owner of the yacht&mdash;what is his name?"</p>

<p>"Dorian Mountcastle," answered Nita.</p>

<p>And the very tone in which she spoke, the lingering
cadence of her voice, betrayed her love. Jack Dineheart
caught the sound of her heart in her voice. His face
paled under its bronze, and his big eyes flashed with
anger.</p>

<p>"Dorian Mountcastle! I've heard of him before. Rich
New York swell. Owns one of the fastest yachts a-going.
Well, and what is Dorian Mountcastle to you, my girl?"
he demanded hoarsely.</p>

<p>"He is my husband," Nita answered proudly; then
recoiled in terror, for an angry cry, coupled with an oath,
burst from the sailor's lips.</p>

<p>"It is a lie, by &mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Nita gazed appalled at his dark features, and realized
with terror that the old, fierce love lived in Jack Dineheart's
heart yet. She drew back from the window, and
the man beneath it raved on in fury until spent with passion,
then called ardently:</p>

<p>"Nita! Tell me that it is not true. You know how
I've worshiped you, and wanted to marry you! I've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
hunted you everywhere, and now, here you are at last,
and you say you're married to that rich swell! I'll not
believe it. He would not marry a poor girl like you."</p>

<p>"Oh, but it is true. He loved me, and we were married
two weeks ago. Oh, Jack, don't be angry. You
have no right, for I always said I couldn't marry you.
And I ran away, you know. But I love Dorian, and he
loves me! Oh, be generous, and go and send him to me
here!"</p>

<p>His face, when he looked up at her again, was murderous
in its expression, and he hissed, in savage rage:</p>

<p>"Send Dorian Mountcastle to you? Yes, I'll send his
black soul to hades within the hour, and make you a
widow!"</p>

<p>Whipping a long-bladed knife from his pocket, Jack
Dineheart flashed it before her eyes, adding wildly:</p>

<p>"This blade will soon find the traitor's heart!"</p>

<p>Then he rushed away madly toward the yacht.</p>

<p>"Oh, Heaven, save my husband!" shrieked Nita, and
fell back unconscious.</p>

<p>There Lizette found her on returning from an unsuccessful
attempt to bribe Mrs. Rhodus, and, being ignorant
of Nita's interview with the sailor, she vehemently
blamed herself for having taken her young mistress from
the bed and leaving her in the chair at the window.</p>

<p>"She was too weak, poor darling, and could not bear
it," she sighed, as she applied restoratives, and got Nita
back into bed.</p>

<p>It was some time before Nita recovered, and then her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
voice failed her when she tried to speak. The shock of
Jack Dineheart's threat had almost killed her, and Lizette
hung over her despairingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is my own fault, my own fault! I ought not
to have told her the yacht was coming. It makes her
suspense all the more terrible," she murmured self-reproachfully.</p>

<p>Suddenly Nita's closed eyes opened, and she moaned
sadly:</p>

<p>"Dorian will be murdered by the sailor with the terrible
knife! Oh, Lizette, save him! save him!"</p>

<p>Lizette's heart gave a muffled thump of terror.</p>

<p>"My mistress is raving," she exclaimed. "Oh, Heaven,
if I could only get away to the yacht and tell Mr. Mountcastle
his wife is alive! I do not believe there is any
big dog outside, as that woman says, for I have never
heard one bark, and I've a great mind to try to get away
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But she did not finish her speech, for there was a rap
at the door, and she opened it to admit Donald Kayne&mdash;Donald
Kayne with a pale, startled face and glittering
gray eyes.</p>

<p>"I have but just come in, and Mrs. Rhodus said you
wanted me," he began, with cold courtesy.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Kayne; I wanted to tell you that Mrs.
Mountcastle's husband came to Fortune's Bay this afternoon.
Look through those iron bars there, and you will
see his yacht."</p>

<p>But he did not look from the window; he was gazing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
with troubled eyes at Nita's pale, excited face as it lay
upon the pillow.</p>

<p>"I have seen the yacht, and I know that Dorian Mountcastle
has come," he answered, in a strained voice, and
added: "I have been told that he is very ill on board the
yacht, and that his heart is breaking over the loss of his
bride!"</p>

<p>Nita did not seem to be aware of the presence of her
foe, although her brilliant eyes were wide open and
staring. She threw out her hands with a desperate gesture,
and cried out, in a voice of agony:</p>

<p>"The sailor will murder Dorian! See his knife, how
it flashes in the air! Oh, Heaven, save my husband!"</p>

<p>Donald Kayne started and trembled with emotion.</p>

<p>"My mistress raves!" cried Lizette reproachfully.
"Oh, sir, for pity's sake, release us, restore her to her
husband's arms!"</p>

<p>"Never, until she confesses where she found the serpent
ring!" he exclaimed, and, almost as though fearing
that Nita's ravings might move him to pity, he rushed
out of the room.</p>

<p>The hours wore on toward night, and Nita slept under
the influence of an opiate administered by the maid.</p>

<p>Night fell and the moon and stars came out and shone
through the iron bars that held Lizette a prisoner with
her hapless mistress. The faithful maid watched patiently
till midnight by the restless invalid.</p>

<p>Suddenly she fancied she heard a slight noise outside
the window, and hastened to look out. She saw a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
in sailor garb climbing up a strong ladder placed against
the house. At sight of her startled face he held up a
warning hand, whispering:</p>

<p>"Hist! Not a word! I am come to save you and Nita.
Wait till I wrench off these iron bars."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>

<h3>TREACHERY.</h3>


<p>Lizette could scarcely repress a cry of surprise, she
was so startled by the sudden appearance of the sailor
whose bronzed face and glittering eyes shone weirdly in
the dim light outside the strong iron bars at the window.
But at his warning she clapped her hand over her open
mouth.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, please, miss," said the sailor. And as Lizette
bent nearer, he continued in a low voice: "I am here to
save you and your mistress, but if the people in the
house should hear us we are lost. I have brought tools
to wrench off these bars, and if your mistress will only
come quietly with me all will be well."</p>

<p>"But who are you?" whispered the maid. "How did
you know about us? Did you come from the yacht? Is
it possible Mr. Mountcastle knows we are here?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he has found out everything, but he could not
come himself. He is very ill, so he sent me. But excuse
me, miss; we mustn't stop to talk. You must prepare
your mistress to go while I wrench off these bars.
Don't let her make any outcry, or the game will be up,
for Rhodus and Kayne will be down upon us at the first
sound."</p>

<p>Lizette knew that it was true, and she saw no cause to
distrust the sailor, who seemed to be honest. With a
heart full of joy she returned to her mistress, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
now stirring restlessly. Lizette bent over her and whispered:</p>

<p>"Wake, dearie, wake. We are going to escape from
our prison."</p>

<p>But the influence of the opiate she had taken had
dulled Nita's tortured brain. At Lizette's loving efforts
to arouse her she only stared in a dull, uncomprehending
way.</p>

<p>"It does not matter, for if she was fully awake she
might be frightened," thought Lizette, and hurriedly
dressed her mistress in the serge boating-suit she had
worn on her wedding-night&mdash;the only gown she now possessed.
She was simply quiescent and passive, like a
little child only half-awake.</p>

<p>The sailor had now succeeded in removing the heavy
iron bars with but slight noise, and he was leaning on
the window-sill waiting with impatience.</p>

<p>"Do not wake her if you can avoid it. I can carry her
in my arms," he called softly to Lizette.</p>

<p>Lizette gathered the passive form to her breast and bore
it to the window. The man held out eager arms, and the
dark head dropped unresistingly upon his shoulder.
Lizette did not notice the keen thrill of joy that shook
the sailor from head to foot as he clasped the precious
burden.</p>

<p>"I will carry her down, and you must follow," he said
gently. "Do not attempt to descend until I am safe at
the bottom. The ladder is not very strong."</p>

<p>Slowly and carefully he bore his burden down the ladder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
clasping her close to a heart that was throbbing
quick and fast with triumph, while Lizette looked on with
trembling suspense.</p>

<p>He reached the ground safely, then&mdash;was it accident
or design?&mdash;a movement of his arm caused the ladder to
slide from the window-sill, and fall with a dull thud to
the ground!</p>

<p>Lizette, who had climbed upon the sill ready to step
out, gave a stifled cry of dismay as she saw the ladder
fall, and the sailor striding away with Nita, while a low
laugh came back to her on the night wind. The deserted
maid threw up her hands with a moan of despair.</p>

<p>An awful suspicion had rushed over her mind at the
sound of the sailor's taunting laugh&mdash;a suspicion of
treachery dark and dire. She had been duped, deceived!
The sailor had not come from Dorian Mountcastle as he
had falsely pretended.</p>

<p>Doubtless he was the paid tool of Donald Kayne, who,
wishing to separate Nita from her only friend, had laid
this cunning trap to carry out his purpose. And, thanks
to her simple credulity, he had succeeded even more
easily than he could have hoped. Here she was locked
securely in this second-story room, for Mrs. Rhodus
always turned the key on her prisoners at night, and
yonder her young mistress was being borne away by the
sailor into another cruel captivity uncheered by the sight
of a friendly face.</p>

<p>Lizette was wild with fear and grief for her lovely
mistress. It seemed to her she had betrayed Nita to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
some fearful fate. She hated herself for her dreadful
mistake, and, frantic with grief, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I will follow or die!"</p>

<p>Springing upon the broad window-sill, she let herself
down first by her hands, then dropped as gently as she
could to the ground.</p>

<p>Then a shriek of uncontrollable pain rent the air. In
her heavy fall she had twisted or broken one of her
ankles.</p>

<p>The pain was so excruciating that after one moment
of supreme agony, she trembled all over, then relapsed
into unconsciousness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was, indeed, Dorian Mountcastle's yacht that had
come into harbor at Fortune's Bay. The Reverend Mr.
Irwin had been put ashore more than a week previous
and sent back to New York with a full purse of gold and
a new stock of experience. Captain Van Hise and the
doctor had remained by Dorian, and helped him pull
through his tedious illness.</p>

<p>He was now slowly convalescing, but there were two
things that greatly retarded his recovery. One was a
deep and silent remorse over the death of Donald Kayne,
whom he had last seen stretched apparently dead upon
the sands at Pirate Beach. The other cause was anxiety
over Nita, about whom the surgeon still kept up the little
fiction of sea-sickness.</p>

<p>One of Dorian's first conscious requests on hearing the
story of his bride's illness was that they should put into
land so that Nita might get well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>"And then we will continue our journey on land, for
although I enjoy yachting very much myself, I do not
wish for my poor little wife to suffer from the agonies of
sea-sickness," he said tenderly.</p>

<p>So by one of the accidents of fate that we call blind
chance the <i>Nita</i> was steered into Fortune's Bay.</p>

<p>"And what the deuce shall we do now? He's asking
for her all the time, and mad with impatience for a sight
of her face," groaned Van Hise to the doctor that night
when they were smoking together upon deck. The hour
was late, nearing midnight, and the surgeon yawned
sleepily.</p>

<p>"I shall keep up the fiction till to-morrow," he said;
"then I shall have to invent something else, for this one
will not serve my purpose any longer. But only Heaven
knows how I am going to get out of this trouble. Tell
him that his bride is drowned I cannot, dare not, for he
would either die or go mad from the shock in his present
weak condition. Well, I will go and have a good-night
look at him and turn in and sleep on it."</p>

<p>"Think I'll go to bed, too," said the captain.</p>

<p>But he lingered a moment with his weed, silently drinking
in the beauty of the summer night, then suddenly
concluded to have a stroll upon the shore before he
retired.</p>

<p>"Just to stretch my legs, for, by Jove! I prefer the
land to the deck," he muttered, as he strode up the gang-plank
and felt his feet on terra firma.</p>

<p>The doctor found Dorian awake and restless, tormented
by the yearning desire for Nita's presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>"Doc, you must let her come to me to-morrow. I cannot
bear this separation any longer!" he cried with impatient
pain.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you that Mrs. Mountcastle was too weak
to leave her berth?"</p>

<p>"Then I will go to her!" cried Dorian.</p>

<p>"You are also too weak to walk," replied his friend.</p>

<p>"Then I will be carried to her berth. I must see her
for myself. I fear that she is worse than you tell me."</p>

<p>"You are exciting yourself, Dorian, in a manner that
I fear may bring on a relapse of your sickness. And
your wound is barely healed, remember. Come, curb this
impatience, and to-morrow things may be more to your
liking. But now I must give you a sedative, or you will
not sleep to-night, and that will be very bad for you."</p>

<p>Dorian was glad to take the sedative that promised
oblivion from vexing thoughts. He swallowed it meekly,
and bade the surgeon good night. He was well enough
now so that they did not have to watch him at night.</p>

<p>The dim flame of the lowered lamp cast a pale gleam
on the wan face, as he lay, with half-shut eyes, trying
vainly to sleep, for the thought of his young bride, the
intense, overpowering yearning to see her again, banished
repose.</p>

<p>Was it the sound of the lapping waves that drowned
a light, quick footstep? He heard nothing, but suddenly
there was a flutter as of woman's robes beside him&mdash;some
one falling on her knees, stretching out tender arms to
clasp his neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>His thoughts had taken embodied shape&mdash;Nita's self
was here, her head on his breast, her kisses burning on
his lips! Dorian clasped his love with passionate tenderness,
and kissed her lips over and over in the mad joy of
seeing her again. Low murmurs of love escaped their
lips, between sweet caresses. He comprehended that her
yearning for him had matched his for her. Weak and
ill as she was, she had eluded her watchers and sought
his side.</p>

<p>"Oh, my love, my darling, how pale and thin you are!
You have suffered greatly," he whispered.</p>

<p>"And you, too, love," she murmured. "You have
suffered also, have you not? But you will get well, now
that I have come back to you, my husband! Oh, how
thankful I am I did not perish in the gloomy sea that
dark night when I was swept into the water with Lizette.
Now I will stay by you and nurse you while you get
strong again. Oh, Dorian, how I love you! Hold me
tight, darling; do not let any one take me away from
you!"</p>

<p>They were wild with joy over their reunion, and to
neither one came the slightest presentiment of the cruel
truth&mdash;that these were parting as well as greeting kisses.</p>

<p>Something put out the dim flame of the lamp, and
there was the sound of a heavy, creaking footstep in the
room. The next moment Nita was torn rudely from her
husband's arms, and her head and face muffled in something
dark and heavy, and she was borne swiftly away
from the yacht.</p>

<h3>A GHOST ON BOARD SHIP.</h3>


<p>Quite close to the yacht <i>Nita</i> was moored a trimly
built, compact little sailing vessel of which Jack Dineheart,
the sailor, was master. It was toward this little
bark that he bore Nita after his daring exploit in kidnaping
her from the Rhodus house.</p>

<p>He had lain at anchor near the island two days, and
was getting ready to sail that night when, upon starting
on an errand to the house of Fisherman Rhodus, he had
been startled by seeing Nita's face behind the barred
window as she watched her husband's yacht in the bay
with sorrowful eyes of love and longing.</p>

<p>After his brief, angry conversation with the girl, Jack
Dineheart had forgotten all about his errand, and rushed
away toward the yacht with murder in his heart toward
Dorian Mountcastle.</p>

<p>Upon nearing it, and seeing several men upon her
deck, his wrath became tempered with prudence, and he
retreated toward his own vessel, where, after fortifying
himself with several glasses of liquor, he concocted the
scheme of kidnaping the imprisoned girl and carrying her
to sea with him, and perhaps back to Pirate Beach to the
grim guardianship of his mother, old Meg Dineheart, the
fortune-teller.</p>

<p>Laughing in fiendish glee at the discomfiture of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
deceived Lizette, the sailor bore Nita away in his strong
arms, his heart leaping with joy.</p>

<p>In the old cabin by the seaside at Pirate Beach, Jack
Dineheart had watched a lovely, somber-eyed little child
budding into exquisite girlhood, and when she was barely
fourteen had sought her for his bride. Her proud refusal
had been followed by a year of such bitter persecution on
the part of himself and his witchlike mother, that at
fifteen Nita had fled from them to the great metropolis
where her valiant struggle to earn her bread had ended
three years later in Central Park, and she had given her
hand in marriage to the old miser for the means of saving
herself from starvation or suicide.</p>

<p>And now she had fallen once more into the hands of
her sailor-lover, who, loving her for her beauty, and
hating her for her scorn, had vowed to punish her by
parting her forever from her husband.</p>

<p>But as he hurried on in the clear moonlight with his
burden the slight form of Nita began to weigh heavily
in his arms.</p>

<p>So he laid Nita, who still seemed fast asleep, down
upon the ground a few moments, and, turning his gaze
from her, began to scrutinize the sky and the sea for
auguries of a successful voyage.</p>

<p>And lying there alone in the cool night air, Nita suddenly
recovered full consciousness of herself and her
surroundings, although she could not remember how she
had come to be there.</p>

<p>Lifting her head and gazing about her in surprise, she
saw before her the ocean, and near at hand the yacht of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
her husband. Behind her, absorbed for the moment in
his scrutiny of the sky, was Jack Dineheart.</p>

<p>Fear and hope combined lent her a new, strange power.
Struggling to her feet, Nita darted noiselessly forward
toward the yacht.</p>

<p>Jack Dineheart, however, discovered her flight just before
she reached the yacht. Furious with rage, he followed,
and, finding every one asleep, audaciously penetrated
to Dorian's cabin and dragged the hapless girl
from the arms of her husband.</p>

<p>Unheeding the loud cry that burst from Dorian's lips,
he escaped safely to his own vessel, and a few minutes
later it left its moorings in the harbor, and set sail for
Pirate Beach.</p>

<p>Dorian Mountcastle was again bereft of his bride, and
Nita was in the power of a relentless lover whose love
was even more dangerous than his enmity.</p>

<p>Captain Van Hise, returning from his moonlight stroll
upon the land, saw the graceful little bark gliding out
upon the ocean, with no thought that she bore Nita away.
He believed that Nita was dead, and in his manly, honest
heart there was a ceaseless sorrow over her untimely
death.</p>

<p>He stepped on the deserted deck, where all was so still
and calm, and his vigorous walk having driven away
all his sleepy feelings, he stole softly to Dorian's berth,
fancying he might be awake and restless and glad of
company. All was dark and still, but at the sound of his
footstep Dorian spoke:</p>

<p>"Is that you Van Hise? Make a light, please."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>The captain obeyed; then asked who had put his light
out.</p>

<p>Dorian answered in a strangely excited voice:</p>

<p>"Nita was here with me a few moments, and I fancy
she must have stolen away from Lizette, for suddenly,
as I held her to my heart and kissed her, the light went
out and some one dragged her away from my arms, and
in spite of my outcry carried her off in dead silence. It
must have been Lizette, of course, but her behavior was
very rude, and so I shall tell her to-morrow."</p>

<p>"My God!" exclaimed Van Hise, his face white, his
eyes staring. A shudder shook him from head to foot;
then he exclaimed uneasily:</p>

<p>"My friend, you have been dreaming!"</p>

<p>"A very blissful dream, although, alas! too brief,"
Dorian answered, with a smile of languid rapture. "My
wife was here, kissed me, and talked to me for a few
happy moments before the maid dragged her away. To-morrow
I must see her again. Oh, Van Hise, I am so
happy that I have seen my darling again I do not think
I shall sleep a wink to-night!"</p>

<p>Van Hise sat down, trembling, his face dead white.</p>

<p>"You must have been asleep," he said decidedly.</p>

<p>"No, I have not slept to-night. Doc was down and
gave me a sedative, but it seemed only a few minutes
later that Nita came to me, and since Lizette took her
away I've been lying here in a happy waking dream."</p>

<p>The soldier repressed a groan, and thought:</p>

<p>"He has dreamed the whole thing, or he has seen poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Nita's wraith. I should not like the seamen to know it,
for only last night they were talking together, and I
heard them say that to see a ghost on board ship was a
sign of shipwreck. Decidedly they must not know of
this, not even the good captain, or they might desert the
yacht in a body!"</p>

<p>He waited until Dorian seemed to fall into a light
doze; then went and woke up the surgeon to tell him
the strange happening.</p>

<p>"Oh, pooh! it was no ghost&mdash;only a vision evoked by
his morphine pill. He can be told to-morrow, if he persists
in his fancy, that Nita's imprudence to-night has
given her a relapse, and that will afford us a new excuse,"
replied the clever surgeon.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>

<h3>DONALD KAYNE'S RETURN.</h3>


<p>Through Azalea Courtney's revelations the elopement
of Dorian Mountcastle and Nita Farnham had become
the sensation of the hour, and innumerable newspaper
paragraphs had chronicled the facts of the duel, the death
of Donald Kayne, the elopement of the young lovers on
the yacht. And then Irwin returned with the story of
the tragedy of Nita's loss at sea with her maid Lizette.</p>

<p>It was a tragedy so full of woe that it thrilled every
heart that read it with sympathy and sorrow. Even the
Courtneys, who hated the girl, grew pale as they realized
how soon Nita's happiness had come to an end, and that
Dorian was so terribly bereft of his love.</p>

<p>But into the ward of Bellevue, where Miser Farnham
lay barely alive, so terribly had he been hurt in the railway
accident, and so slight were his chances for life,
penetrated no tidings from the outer world. None there
knew anything of the beautiful ward who had eloped
with her lover the very night of the accident. Charles
Farnham was supposed to be friendless and poor, save
for some miserly savings of whose hiding-place none had
any knowledge. No one took any interest in his fate
except the doctors and nurses at Bellevue, and they all
believed that it was impossible that he should recover
from his internal injuries. He was alive and little more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
He had never uttered a conscious word since the accident.</p>

<p>As for the Courtneys, they were still at Gray Gables,
carrying out their policy of masterly inaction. The
flight of Nita and the condition of the miser made no
difference to them. A lawyer, acting under instructions
received from Farnham previous to the accident, was
entrusted with the conduct of expenses incident to the
housekeeping at Gray Gables. Everything went on like
clock-work, except that the good housekeeper, Mrs. Hill,
who had grown to love her young mistress so dearly,
carried always a sad face and aching heart for poor Nita's
tragic fate.</p>

<p>Weeks flew past, and it would have been very lonely
at Gray Gables but that the Courtneys invited some city
friends for a few weeks, and got through the July days
with some bathing, dressing, boating, and dancing, not
keeping up any pretense of mourning over Nita's supposed
death.</p>

<p>Meg Dineheart, the old fortune-teller, still prowled
about the beach like a bird of evil omen, and had twice
been driven ignominiously out of Gray Gables with
threats of arrest if she ever showed her face there again.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, Meg was slyly seeking for Nita's
chest of gold that Lizette had carefully hidden in the
closet of her mistress, but she found such lynx eyes
watching her whenever she ventured into the old stone
mansion that she almost despaired of success.</p>

<p>During the summer, Meg had made two trips to New
York to see Miser Farnham at the hospital, but she got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
no good out of these visits. He still lingered in that
strange, comatose condition, taking no notice of anything,
and yet improving slowly but appreciably, so the nurses
said, until they began to believe that he would really get
well again.</p>

<p>"The old wretch! I wish he would die, then maybe
Jack and me would get the handling of all that money if
only we knew where it was hid," muttered Meg angrily,
and she was in no wise pleased to learn that he was likely
to recover.</p>

<p>She was very anxious for her son Jack to return from
his last trip to sea, for he had been away several months,
and she was eager to know what he would say to the
happenings at Pirate Beach since he went away, the
return and death of Nita, whom he had wished to marry,
and the accident to the miser, whose gold both mother
and son greedily coveted.</p>

<p>New York had another sensation the middle of August
when Donald Kayne, the millionaire, who was believed to
have been killed in the duel with Dorian Mountcastle
returned, alive and well, to the city in his own yacht.</p>

<p>"It was all a mistake, the report of my death. My antagonist
was much more seriously wounded than myself,
and I have heard had a hard tussle for life," he told his
friends carelessly.</p>

<p>Yet a strange change had come over Donald Kayne.
Always nervous and restless, his friends observed that
he was now more so than ever before. He veered from
place to place. He could hardly be seen at his club any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
more. And no one had any news of Dorian Mountcastle's
whereabouts until received through him.</p>

<p>"My yacht stayed a few days at Fortune's Bay," he
said. "While there I heard that Dorian Mountcastle's
yacht had been there before me. Dorian had been recovering
slowly from the wound I gave him, and he had not
been told of the tragic death of his wife. When it could
be kept from him no longer the truth was broken to him
gently, but it almost bereft him of reason. The last I
heard of him was that his friends had taken him abroad
for a year to recuperate his health."</p>

<p>He went down to Pirate Beach to see the Courtneys,
who were very gracious. Azalea had almost given up all
hope of ever winning Dorian, and she tried all her fascinations
on Donald Kayne.</p>

<p>But he was cold, taciturn and moody, and had no interest
in anything except the mystery that had brought
him to Pirate Beach&mdash;the mystery of Nita Farnham's
possession of the serpent ring. But in spite of Azalea's
efforts she had nothing to tell him, beyond what she had
written him before the duel.</p>

<p>"And yet, I believe," she said, "that the old fortune-teller,
who lives in an old boat-cabin down the beach,
knows more about Nita than the most of us. I have
talked with her, and she is very mysterious. She would
neither admit nor deny any knowledge of Nita, but if I
had not been too poor to bribe her I believe she would
have given me some information."</p>

<p>Donald Kayne sought Meg Dineheart at sunset, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
found her standing alone in the strange purple glow by
the sea, a weird, witchlike figure, with elf-locks streaming
on the breeze, while she shaded her eyes with her
hand and strained her gaze across the darkening waters,
watching, as she was always watching now, for her son's
bark to come sailing home.</p>

<p>She turned upon the intruder with a curse, but Azalea
had been right in believing that gold would loosen the
old harpy's tongue.</p>

<p>Kayne soon learned that Nita had been reared at
Pirate Beach by the old fortune-teller, until at the age of
fifteen she had run away to make her own living at the
metropolis.</p>

<p>"What is the girl to you?" asked Donald Kayne, but
she leered and refused to reply.</p>

<p>"And the serpent ring she wore? I will make your
fortune, old woman, if you will tell me how Nita Farnham
came by that ring," he exclaimed eagerly.</p>

<p>Bitterly did Meg regret that she could not gratify his
curiosity.</p>

<p>"I know nothing of the ring, except that I saw it on
Nita's hand before she went away on Mountcastle's
yacht. Stay&mdash;you say there is but one ring like it in the
world? Then I saw the same ring more than fourteen
years ago on another woman's hand."</p>

<p>"You saw her? Where? Where, woman?" he cried in
fierce excitement.</p>

<p>The old witch peered curiously into the face of her interlocutor.
Donald Kayne's face was wild and haggard.
Unconsciously to himself, in his wild excitement, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
stretched out his hand and clutched the woman's shoulder
in a grasp that was painful.</p>

<p>"Speak!" he uttered hoarsely; "speak this instant, and
tell me when and where you saw the woman with the
serpent ring. Why are you so dumb when you see how
impatient I am! Answer before I throttle you!"</p>

<p>But with a ghastly grin Meg writhed herself out of
his grasp and sneered:</p>

<p>"That secret is worth gold to me!"</p>

<p>"Harpy," he cried, and thrust his hands into his
pockets, but withdrew them disappointed. He had already
given her all the money about him. He tore the
watch from his pocket, the ring from his hand, and flung
them at her feet.</p>

<p>"Take these, and speak!" he cried, but Meg spurned
them with her foot.</p>

<p>"It is not enough! Besides, I do not want jewels, but
money!"</p>

<p>"You shall have money to-morrow. But do not keep
me waiting, I implore you! I am mad, mad for the clue
you can give me. Speak now, for sweet pity's sake!
Tell me all you know, and if it is worth anything to me,
I will reward you richly."</p>

<p>But the woman began to realize that her knowledge
was valuable, and decided to sell it dearly.</p>

<p>"The gold first!" she cried. "You are a stranger to
me, and if I told you the secret first you might go away
and never pay me!"</p>

<p>Vainly he entreated and implored, promising money
upon the morrow, but Meg was immovable. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
insensible to the pitiful anxiety of his haggard face. She
obstinately refused his prayer, mocking at his impatience.</p>

<p>Donald Kayne, mad with impatient wrath, lifted his
hand and struck her lightly across the mouth.</p>

<p>"Take that, you devil!" he cried hoarsely, and with a
shriek of rage Meg sprung at him with a knife drawn.</p>

<p>"I will kill you!" she hissed, with savage fury.</p>

<p>But Donald Kayne was more than a match for the
tigress, and soon disarmed her, although in the struggle
he received a wound in the hand.</p>

<p>He flung the knife into the sea, and wrapped his handkerchief
about the wound, while she stood at a little
distance watching him with glowering eyes.</p>

<p>But his heart sank as he realized that his imprudence
had defeated his own object, and that he might never be
able to wrest from her the longed-for secret. But there
was no present help for it, and he hurried from her along
the beach toward Gray Gables.</p>

<p>Meg shook her fist after him, and muttered anathemas
upon him until he was almost out of sight; then turned
her eyes again upon the sea, where the last fading rays
of sunset lingered in radiant light.</p>

<p>A sudden cry of joy shrilled over her lips. Across the
water, in clear sight, was riding a trimly built little sailing
craft, that had a very familiar look to her old eyes.</p>

<p>"My son's bark!" she shrieked joyfully.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>

<h3>PEPITA!</h3>


<p>Donald Kayne did not hear the old woman's shriek
of joy, nor see Jack Dineheart's craft. He flung along
the sands with a long, striding step, his heart seething
with rage and pain, and, entering the grounds at Gray
Gables, sought a seat among the thick shrubberies to
muse undisturbed over his troubles.</p>

<p>The startling disappearance of Nita from the Rhodus
house had filled him with vague alarm and unowned
remorse. He knew that she was not with Dorian, and
also knew that the bereaved young husband had been told
that his young bride was dead.</p>

<p>He had heard, too, while in hiding on the island, that
grave fears were entertained for Dorian's reason. He
had been terribly shocked the morning after Nita's disappearance
when poor Lizette had been found moaning
upon the ground, where she had fallen from the window.
The maid's ankle had sustained a dreadful sprain, and
she had several bruises of a very painful character. She
was carried into the house and carefully attended, but it
was several hours before she could tell how her accident
had happened.</p>

<p>Donald Kayne believed at first that it must have been
an emissary from Dorian who had carried Nita away,
but the careful inquiries made afterward revealed the
fact that she was not upon the yacht.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>The guilty man who, in imprisoning Nita, had not intended
that any harm should come to her, was confronted
by the terrible mystery of Nita's betrayal into
some unknown and awful fate. Cruelly disappointed
and angry as he had been over Nita's refusal to gratify
his curiosity, he could not rid himself of the impression
that it was not mere girlish perversity on her part.</p>

<p>He was haunted by the look in Nita's eyes the night
when he had knelt at her feet, begging her to confess
the truth. He had told the girl he was her enemy, and
that he would persecute her, but he had not dreamed of
anything like this.</p>

<p>He had promised Azalea to return and report his luck
with old Meg, but he felt averse to seeking the pretty
girl yet, so he remained in the old garden-chair, with
his head bowed despondingly on his hand, while darkness
fell round him, and up at the old stone house the
windows began to glow with lights, while from the open
windows of the parlor Azalea Courtney's voice broke
upon the air in a song.</p>

<p>Azalea's voice was clear, sweet, and well-trained, and
she had chosen a sweet and melancholy strain that
blended fittingly with the pensive twilight hour:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'There never was a love like mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For since my darling went away<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There has not been a night or day,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through winter's snow or summer's shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But he is with me<br /></span>
<span class="i17">Constantly!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The pathetic words sank deep into the tortured heart
of the man, listening out in the dusk and dew, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
murmur of the sea in his ears and the heavy perfume of
flowers all around. He pressed his heavy brow against
the back of his seat, murmuring over the words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'There never was a love like mine!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Azalea stopped singing, but played on in dreamy mood
a low, sad nocturne.</p>

<p>Suddenly, through the stillness of the garden, a faint
sound reached his ear&mdash;a sound like a human sigh, then:</p>

<p>"Donald!"</p>

<p>With a start and a cry he lifted his head.</p>

<p>"Donald," was breathed tremulously upon the air
again.</p>

<p>But there was no one near. Thrilling with awe, he
glared into the darkness. The night was dark, and there
in the shade of the tall firs and shrubberies, the shadows
were dense. He could barely distinguish the outlines of
his own hand. And yet as he gazed the voice called him
again, softly, tenderly, beseechingly:</p>

<p>"Donald!"</p>

<p>"Who is there? Who calls?" he asked eagerly, and
no voice replied, but out of the darkness there began to
form before him at a little distance a faint, silvery something
like a cloud taking shape and form. It grew more
and more dense until it assumed the form of a woman&mdash;a
mist-woman, shadowy, faint, yet luminous with a
soft, unearthly glow, and beautiful as an angel with spiritual
face, and slender, beckoning hands.</p>

<p>A strange spell came over the gazer, a spell of tender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
awe and ineffable peace. He spoke, and his voice
was low and soft, like a sigh of love:</p>

<p>"Pepita."</p>

<p>For a moment the silvery mist wavered there in its
wondrous beauty before him; then, all at once, it began
to move backward from him with a floating movement
of ineffable grace, the dark, solemn eyes still fixed on
his, while the beckoning hand and etherial voice both
breathed:</p>

<p>"Come!"</p>

<p>Donald Kayne arose like one in a dream, and followed
the floating mist on and on through winding
paths overgrown here and there with grass and weeds,
toward the house, blundering on in a dazed way like a
drunken man, tearing his hands upon thorny, outstretched
branches of roses, shaking down splatters of
dew that wet his face and hair.</p>

<p>The radiant shape was leading him on and on toward
the house, and the nearer they came the more faint and
indistinct it grew.</p>

<p>At last&mdash;when close to the old gray stone wall, and
when his outstretched hands almost touched it&mdash;the phantom
shape moved straight against the wall and melted
into thin air like a bubble.</p>

<p>Donald Kayne, with a cry of agony, clutched at the
fading form, and fell forward heavily against the wall,
striking his temple with resounding force. The blow
stunned him and flung him backward, half-unconscious
upon the grass. He did not know that he lay there for
an hour ere he struggled back to thought and memory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>He struggled up to his feet and gazed at the blank
wall, so chill and dark, where the spirit-form had disappeared.</p>

<p>"I have seen a ghost," he shuddered. "It was Pepita
in all her beauty. Yet I saw through and beyond her
the trees and flowers. She is dead, my Pepita, I know it
at last!"</p>

<h3>NITA AT GRAY GABLES AGAIN.</h3>


<p>The sun was sinking out of sight, and the curlew's
call came shrilly across the waves when Jack Dineheart's
fishing-boat anchored in the bay, and a little
cockle-shell of a row-boat brought him across to his
mother's cabin.</p>

<p>She was watching for him eagerly and with amazed
eyes, for when the sailor left the little boat he carried in
his arms the form of a woman lying inert like one dead
against his shoulder, while her face and head were
shrouded in a large plaid shawl.</p>

<p>"Hush! not a word," he breathed hoarsely to his
mother, with a warning nod toward the sailor who had
rowed the boat across, and he strode to the cabin with
his silent burden. When he laid the quiet figure down
upon a lounge and withdrew the shawl from the face,
Meg recoiled with a cry of wonder and alarm.</p>

<p>It was Nita&mdash;Nita, whom every one believed dead.
She looked like a dead woman now. Her face and lips
were white, and the long, black fringe of the thick, curly
lashes lay heavily against her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Don't look so frightened. She is not dead," said
Jack Dineheart roughly. "I drugged her to bring her
here without an outcry&mdash;that is all. She'll come to presently,
all right."</p>

<p>"But, Jack, where did you find her? I thought she
was dead."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>"Old woman, I can't stay to answer questions now.
I've got to go back to my ship and steer her into harbor.
I'll come back as soon as I can. And, in the
meantime, don't you let her get away."</p>

<p>"I'll keep her all right," Meg replied, with one of her
hideous grins, and then he went away, returning later
to find her waiting for him on the steps outside.</p>

<p>"She has come to, and is almost crazy to get away, so
I locked her in and came out here to wait for you," she
said. He sat down close to her, and confided his story
to her ears, ending with:</p>

<p>"I brought her over to my boat and told them all she
was my crazy sister. Bill Skipper and his wife had
seen her here four years ago, and so there was no one
to contradict my story, and old Mother Skipper took
care of her all the way, for she was sick and nearly
died on the voyage."</p>

<p>"And what do you expect to do with her now?"
grimly inquired old Meg.</p>

<p>A string of oaths broke from his lips, in the midst
of which she distinguished an avowed determination to
force Nita to become his wife.</p>

<p>"But you said she was married to that young swell."</p>

<p>"He's dead by now!" was the vicious reply. "And,
whether he's dead or not, she shall marry me."</p>

<p>It was so dark Meg could not see his face, but she
knew he was terribly in earnest. She sat silently musing
several moments until he exclaimed irritably:</p>

<p>"Why don't you say something? You used to be as
much up for the plan as I was."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>"Things are different now, Jack," she answered in a
troubled tone, and when he questioned her she told him
the story of the night when the old miser had brought
Nita to Gray Gables as his ward.</p>

<p>"Now, Jack, you know you can defy anybody in the
world except old Miser Farnham, and you daren't do
that. He claims her now, and all you can do is to let
her go back up yonder to Gray Gables and queen it over
us again," she ended bitterly.</p>

<p>She was frightened at the terrible explosion of wrath
that followed her words. The man raved and stormed,
and she, although a fury to every one else, cowered in
silence under his wrath. She knew that in spite of himself
he must yield to the mysterious power the old miser
held over them both. From the cot where he lay half-dead
in Bellevue, he seemed to reach out a hand in grim
menacing that cowed burly Jack Dineheart into instant,
though grumbling, obedience.</p>

<p>"If I had known this I would have drowned Nita in
the sea before I would have brought her back here," he
growled.</p>

<p>But when Meg proposed to take the girl immediately
back to Gray Gables, he did not interpose the least objection.
The woman unlocked the cabin-door and entered,
finding Nita sobbing hysterically upon the old
ragged lounge.</p>

<p>"Dry up that sniveling, girl, and come along with me
up to Gray Gables!" she cried roughly.</p>

<p>Nita sprang up in trembling hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you mean it, Meg? Oh, will you indeed be so
kind?" she faltered.</p>

<p>"Yes, I mean it, and I hope you won't forget Jack
and me for our goodness. We are poor as dirt, you
know, and it's worth a pretty penny to rescue you from
prison and bring you safe back to Pirate Beach," grunted
the hag, making the most she could out of her son's enforced
relinquishment of his prize.</p>

<p>"Oh, I will reward you richly! You and Jack shall
have handfuls of gold to-morrow," promised the grateful
girl, and, leaning on Meg's arm, for she was very
weak, Nita left the cabin, and proceeded slowly toward
Gray Gables.</p>

<p>She saw no more of her rough suitor, for, furious with
disappointment, he had taken himself out of the way.</p>

<p>Nita's heart beat high with hope as she neared her
home. Meg had not thought of telling her that Miser
Farnham was yet alive, and the girl could think of nothing
except how soon she would be reunited to her young
husband.</p>

<p>More than six weeks had elapsed since Nita and Lizette
had left Gray Gables for the yachting excursion with
Dorian Mountcastle that had resulted so disastrously.
Yet, how familiar everything looked as the girl went with
weak, faltering footsteps up the broad steps into the
lighted hall.</p>

<p>The broad front doors were wide open, and also the
parlor door. From it came the sound of gay voices and
merry laughter. Meg Dineheart, with a love of sensation,
dragged Nita to this door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>The Courtneys had several city guests lingering still,
and Donald Kayne had joined them but a short while
before. He sat near the window, with a dull, dazed
look on his face, speaking but little, and listening with
an effort to the careless words of the guests.</p>

<p>Upon this scene broke the bent figure of the old fortune-teller,
with Nita by her side.</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney was entertaining a guest in her most
stately manner, but the words she was uttering died unspoken
on her lips, and she sprang up with a strangled
cry of alarmed surprise:</p>

<p>"Nita Farnham!"</p>

<p>"Nita Farnham!" echoed Azalea, in appalled tones,
as though she had seen a ghost.</p>

<p>Ere Nita could speak old Meg's thin, rasping voice
broke upon the hubbub of surprise, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Yes, it's Nita Farnham, ma'am, sure enough. She
wasn't drowned at sea, in spite of the storm. My son
saved her life, and brought her back to Pirate Beach to-night.
I hope you're glad to see her back," and she
pushed Nita into a chair near the door and retreated,
leaving her charge alone among them.</p>

<p>The eyes of the guests were upon the Courtneys, and
no matter how they felt, it was incumbent on them to
welcome Nita in a cordial manner. Nita got two cold
little pecks on the cheek from mother and daughter, and
some little murmurs of affection that she took at their
true valuation.</p>

<p>Introductions followed, but Nita was weary, and rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
from her seat, saying faintly that she would go to her
room.</p>

<p>Some one came forward and offered his arm, and she
shrank and trembled when she perceived that it was Donald
Kayne. He bent and whispered, inaudibly, to the
others:</p>

<p>"Say nothing yet, I beseech you. I was mad to do
what I did, but God only knows the suffering that drove
me to desperation."</p>

<p>In spite of herself Nita's heart was touched with pity.
He had treated her infamously, yet somehow she could
not hate him. Her tender heart always ached over the
secret she could not betray to him, and her dreams were
often haunted by the name "Pepita," that he had uttered
in such a tragic tone.</p>

<p>She raised her dark, reproachful eyes to his face, and
whispered sadly:</p>

<p>"You need not fear me."</p>

<p>But she was trembling so that she could not touch
his offered arm, and she looked appealingly at Mrs.
Courtney.</p>

<p>"I would like for Mrs. Hill to attend me to my room,"
she said gently.</p>

<p>"My dear girl, the housekeeper has an evening out,
but I will attend you myself," was the affectionate reply,
and Mrs. Courtney, coming forward, led Nita up-stairs
and unlocked the door of her room.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hill found it necessary to lock your room," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
said. "That old woman you came with to-night has been
prowling about here trying to steal something."</p>

<p>She pushed open the windows and let in the cool air.
Then she lighted a lamp, adding carelessly:</p>

<p>"Everything is just as you left it, my dear. Although
we believed you dead, it seemed best to trouble nothing
until after your guardian's recovery."</p>

<p>Nita had sunk down wearily upon a lounge, her dark
head falling among the satin pillows, but at those words
she rose up with a startled cry:</p>

<p>"My&mdash;my&mdash;guardian!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney, settling herself cozily into an easy
chair, replied blandly:</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot you went away with Dorian that day,
and did not hear about Miser Farnham's terrible accident."</p>

<p>"But, yes, I did, Mrs. Courtney, oh, yes. They told
me on the yacht that night. Captain Van Hise told me&mdash;that
my guardian had been killed on the elevated railroad,"
Nita cried eagerly, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"He was mistaken," Mrs. Courtney answered placidly.
"He was severely wounded, and it was believed that he
would certainly die, but he is still alive at Bellevue Hospital,
and although nothing but a wreck still, the doctors
and nurses say that he will be sure to recover."</p>

<p>She never forgot the white horror of the girl's face,
nor the anguish of despair in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Alive?" cried Nita wildly, "alive? Why, how can
that be? I am married to Dorian, you know!"</p>

<p>"Yes; and it was a very reprehensible affair, I think,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Mrs. Courtney answered stiffly. "An elopement always
carries with it the odor of disgrace."</p>

<p>But Nita was deaf to her words of blame. With a
stifled moan of the bitterest despair, she fell back unconscious.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>

<h3>THE MISER SENDS FOR HIS BRIDE.</h3>


<p>"What a nuisance!" muttered Mrs. Courtney, but she
bathed Nita's face until she came to herself with a long,
low sigh of deepest pain.</p>

<p>"I have been dreaming&mdash;oh, such a dreadful dream!"
she shuddered.</p>

<p>"No, it was not a dream, Nita. I was telling you
your guardian was alive, and you fainted&mdash;from excess
of joy, I suppose," added the lady maliciously.</p>

<p>Nita sat up and pressed her small hand wearily to
her brow. Despair made her brave.</p>

<p>"No, Mrs. Courtney, it was excess of sorrow," she answered
frankly.</p>

<p>"Oh, you cruel, wicked girl!"</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" asked Nita, with calmness. "No
matter, I was glad when I heard that he was dead. I
hated him&mdash;oh, I cannot tell you how I feared and hated
him."</p>

<p>"But why?" curiously.</p>

<p>"Can you ask?" cried Nita despairingly. "Who could
love that grim, horrible old man? And I told you once&mdash;you
remember that night&mdash;that he would never, never
let me marry Dorian!"</p>

<p>"Yet you married him, all the same, so what does his
life matter? He cannot undo the elopement!" returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Mrs. Courtney, wondering at the girl's strange words
and manner.</p>

<p>"But I believed that he was dead. Oh, Mrs. Courtney,
listen patiently, please. I did not know that my
impatient lover had made any plans to elope with me
when I went on the yacht for a moonlight trip. Then
came the duel, you know, and Dorian was so badly
wounded. He sent his friend to ask me to marry him,
but at first I refused, for I knew my guardian would
never consent, and I did not dare disobey him! Oh,
you cannot guess how I fear that horrible old man!
Then Captain Van Hise told me he was dead, and I consented
to marry Dorian. We were married, and only a
few minutes afterward I was swept into the sea by the
great wave rolling over the ship. Oh, God! why was I
saved from death to meet this awful fate?&mdash;to be parted
forever from my own love, when happiness seemed so
near?"</p>

<p>"But your guardian cannot punish you for marrying
your lover&mdash;these fears are quite groundless, Nita," Mrs.
Courtney said, coldly, but decidedly.</p>

<p>"Oh, madam, I am the most friendless and unhappy
girl in the whole world!" she cried passionately. "I
have no kindred hearts to pity me, no one to care for
me! You have never liked me, I know, but I plead
with you to have pity on me, and try to be my friend.
Oh, I will be so grateful for a little kindness and pity
in this dark hour!"</p>

<p>An earthquake could hardly have shocked Mrs. Courtney
more than this humble plea from Nita, who had always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
resented her dislike and given her scorn for scorn.
She put out her slender, aristocratic hand and clasped
Nita's gently, drawing her to a seat by her side.</p>

<p>"My dear girl, of course I am your friend, and will
do anything in the world for you," she exclaimed. "But
let me tell you that you are very nervous and fanciful
to-night. How can you call yourself friendless and
alone when you have a rich and noble husband like
Dorian Mountcastle? I assure you that a loving husband
is always a woman's best friend. Then, too, you
have a doting guardian."</p>

<p>The girl rose from her seat and stood before the woman,
pale as a ghost.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Courtney, do not call them my friends, those
two men," she said, almost sternly. "From to-night and
henceforth forever, they are my bitterest foes."</p>

<p>Surprise held the listener dumb, and Nita continued:</p>

<p>"Never again while the world stands will I consent
ever to look upon the face of Charles Farnham or Dorian
Mountcastle."</p>

<p>"The girl is mad, mad as a March hare. Her adventures
have turned her brain," murmured Mrs. Courtney
amazedly.</p>

<p>"No, madam, I am not mad, I am perfectly sane, and
I wish to make you an offer. Will you and Azalea go
abroad with me, and travel wherever you wish for a year?
I am rich. I will pay every expense if you will chaperon
me on this trip. I will be perfectly frank with you. I
want to avoid the two men of whom we have been speaking.
I am afraid of them both. I have wronged them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
both, yet I am innocent of blame. Yet I fear the miser's
hate and Dorian's love in equal measure. Oh, madam,
be kind to me. Grant my prayer, and I will be forever
grateful! And the time will come, I swear it to you,
when you will say to yourself and to the world: 'I am
glad I was kind to poor Nita, and had no hand in her
tragic fate.' What say you, madam? Shall we start
to-morrow on our travels?"</p>

<p>Nita need not have felt any doubt over the answer. It
was the strangest turn of Fortune's wheel that Mrs.
Courtney had ever known&mdash;the strangest, and the most
welcome.</p>

<p>She felt that behind it lay some strange dark mystery,
a baffling mystery that it should be her task to ferret
out if it lay in mortal power, but in the meantime she
accepted Nita's offer with pretended reluctance, putting
it solely as a favor to the young girl. Then, after recommending
her to retire as early as possible, she returned
to her guests with a heart full of secret exultation.</p>

<p>Nita locked her door and fell down on her couch in a
fit of hysterical sobbing. Mrs. Courtney's revelation had
shown her all the horror of her position. Wife to two
living men, she loathed the one who had the legal right
to claim her.</p>

<p>And Nita knew, and the knowledge added poignancy
to her pain, that it was her own fault. Why had she
betrothed herself to Dorian when she was not free,
cheating herself with a little semblance of happiness,
and so led him on to the elopement that must now wreck
his life?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>She believed that Miser Farnham's wrath would be
murderous when he recovered and learned what she had
done. And Dorian, how he would hate her for her sin!</p>

<p>She would rather die than meet Dorian again&mdash;he
whom she had so terribly deceived. If he cursed her
for her folly she could not bear it; she must die at his
feet of her bitter shame&mdash;and if he forgave her madness
and loved her still, what then? Still she was not free!
And how could she own the truth to him? She could
never do that. She would sooner fly to the other end of
the world.</p>

<p>She leaned from the window, and gazed upon the
great ocean and the starlit sky.</p>

<p>"Oh, how beautiful the world is, and why should there
be so much unhappiness in it?" she cried.</p>

<p>Nita's musings were interrupted by the sudden entrance
of Mrs. Hill, the housekeeper, who was wild with
joy over the news of Nita's return.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Courtney has told me how you were saved by a
sailor, and brought back," she cried gladly, and added
in a more subdued key: "But poor Lizette, that dear,
good girl, what a pity she was not saved, too."</p>

<p>Nita was about to exclaim that Lizette was alive, but
she suddenly remembered Donald Kayne's entreaty for
her silence, and made no reply. In spite of his cruelty,
she pitied the man.</p>

<p>Jack Dineheart had told her that the maid, on finding
herself entrapped and deserted, had jumped from the
window and broken her neck, but she tried not to believe
the horrible story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>All that Donald Kayne had told in New York about
Dorian Mountcastle was true. When concealment was
no longer possible his friends had been obliged to break
to him, as gently as might be, the news of Nita's death,
and that it was her wraith, and not a living girl, that
had appeared to him on board the yacht that fateful
night. The despair of the bereaved young husband was
awful in its intensity. His reason tottered, and it was
found necessary to place him in strict confinement, and
guard him closely for several days until his violent mood
subsided into moody melancholy.</p>

<p>Captain Van Hise was tender and devoted as a woman
to his stricken friend, and when Dorian, after weeks of
despair, became a pale, quiet shadow of his former self,
he persuaded him to go abroad with him.</p>

<p>They went, but Dorian dwelt ceaselessly on the memory
of that strange night when Nita had come to him
and laid her head on his breast and her arms about his
neck&mdash;aye, and kissed him, too, with ardent lips that
seemed to burn with the breath of life. He prayed
Heaven to grant him that sweet vision of his lost love
again.</p>

<p>Van Hise was in despair.</p>

<p>"He will go crazy in earnest if he keeps on this way,"
he said to himself, despondently.</p>

<p>It was nearing spring then, and they were in Paris.
But Dorian was familiar with Paris. Perhaps he had exhausted
its delights long ago. He wearied of its splendors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am tired. Let us go somewhere else," he said impatiently.</p>

<p>"But, my dear fellow, we have been everywhere."</p>

<p>"No, we have not. I know some men who are going
on a journey into the interior of Norway. I have accepted
for us both their invitation to join the party," said
reckless Dorian.</p>

<p>"It will be quite out of the world," groaned the soldier,
but he yielded.</p>

<p>It was strange that Dorian and Nita should both be
abroad so many months without meeting each other, or
even being aware of each other's movements.</p>

<p>And yet it was a fact that Captain Van Hise and Dorian
had never even heard that Nita was alive, and Nita
knew nothing of Dorian since the fateful night when
Jack Dineheart had torn her from his arms and carried
her back to Pirate Beach.</p>

<p>Since she had gone abroad with the Courtneys, life
had been one feverish whirl of gayety, change, and sight-seeing.
Nita, with her heart upon the rack, and a smile
upon her lips, had borne her part bravely in all, lavishing
gold like water in the pursuit of forgetfulness. The
Courtneys, nothing loath, accepted her munificence, and
made the most of it, although wondering at her reckless
extravagance. They did not know how often she
said to herself:</p>

<p>"The chest of gold is melting like snow in the sun,
but why should I care? There remain to me but a few
more months of life and liberty, then&mdash;darkness, nothingness,
and death. Let me make the most of it!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney had been in London in her days of
prosperity, and had acquaintances among the nobility. In
the spring, when the London season set in, she introduced
her ward into the most fashionable set. And the
fashionable world raved over the charms of <i>la belle
Americaine</i>.</p>

<p>She had lovers by the score. Hearts and titles were
laid at her feet, but all soon echoed what Mrs. Courtney
had frankly told them of Nita:</p>

<p>"She has no heart."</p>

<p>Nita only smiled when they accused her of her fault.</p>

<p>"It is quite true," she said. "I have no heart to give
any one. Why do you not fall in love with pretty, golden-haired
Azalea?"</p>

<p>One man, piqued at her indifference, tried to take
her advice. He transferred his attention to the affable
blonde.</p>

<p>He was Sir George Merlin, a wealthy baronet, middle-aged,
but very goodlooking. He was vain and conceited,
and Nita's rejection hurt his pride as well as his
love. He proposed to Azalea through pure pique.</p>

<p>The blonde accepted gladly, and Mrs. Courtney was
transported with joy. The only drawback to her bliss
was that the baronet did not seem in any hurry to name
the wedding-day. But the engagement was formally announced,
and his sister gave a ball in honor of the fair
Azalea.</p>

<p>Nita's thoughts often wandered to Dorian. Where
was he? What was he doing? Did he know that she
was alive, or did he mourn her dead? Somehow, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
first she had looked for him, dreaded his appearance
with mingled pain and pleasure. As the months went
past she gave up the thought of his coming. She began
to fancy that he must be dead.</p>

<p>Sometimes it all seemed to her like a feverish dream,
those strange past days of love and pain; yet all the
time she was drawing nearer and nearer to the fatal end
of the year, to the moment when her hated master would
claim her as his bride.</p>

<p>It was May now, and the world was all in bloom.
Charles Farnham would be coming to claim his bride.</p>

<p>On the very day of Lady Landon's ball for Azalea,
Mrs. Courtney received a letter commanding her to return
at once to New York with her charge. Mrs. Courtney
went at once to Nita in her room.</p>

<p>"Nita, I must break through your rule, never to mention
your guardian's name to you. I have a letter from
him."</p>

<p>Nita turned a pale face of fear and despair.</p>

<p>"A&mdash;letter!" she faltered; "so, then&mdash;he&mdash;he&mdash;is coming
for&mdash;me?"</p>

<p>The white terror of her face was enough to move a
heart of stone. Mrs. Courtney smiled reassuringly.</p>

<p>"Do not look so frightened, Nita, there is no need, for
he writes very kindly of you, and makes no mention of
your marriage. Perhaps he means to forgive you and
Dorian," she said, feeling magnanimous toward the girl
now that Azalea's market was made.</p>

<p>Nita only sunk helplessly into a chair, her face white,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
her eyes wild. It seemed as if she could not reply. Mrs.
Courtney, with her eyes on the letter, continued:</p>

<p>"Mr. Farnham is quite well again, and wants me to
hasten home with you. He says that he has bought
and furnished a Fifth Avenue palace for you, with carriages
and horses of the finest, and is most anxious to
see you queening it in New York society. Indeed, Nita,
after the training I have given you, it will be easy for
you to do so"&mdash;complacently. "Really, my dear, the old
man seems very proud and fond of you, and I never
heard of a more generous guardian. You are a very
fortunate girl, and I am sure you have only to ask him,
and he will pardon you and Dorian."</p>

<p>"Ah! you do not know, you do not dream," moaned
the girl, hiding her face in her hands.</p>

<p>Must she go? must she obey the old miser's command?</p>

<p>"This letter has been following us about for some
time, and I must reply to it to-morrow," continued the
lady. "What shall I say to him, Nita? That we will
cross next week?"</p>

<p>"I will not go!" cried Nita, with a frantic gesture.</p>

<p>"But, really, Nita, I think we must go. I cannot
understand this strange fear of your guardian. A young
girl like you must obey either her guardian or her husband.
You repudiate the claim of Dorian Mountcastle,
and so you remain subject to the orders of Mr. Farnham."</p>

<p>"Let us speak no more of it now. I will decide to-morrow,"
Nita answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney knew that it was almost time to dress
for the ball, so she retired, determined in her own mind
that she would take Nita speedily back to New York
and Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p>"Our leaving now will force Sir George to ask Azalea
to name the wedding-day," she thought sagely. "And
Nita is so generous I think she will readily purchase the
trousseau. The marriage can take place from the miser's
place, and Sir George need never know how very poor
we are."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>

<h3>"LET US DIE TOGETHER."</h3>


<p>"A gentleman to see Miss Farnham."</p>

<p>Nita was in her ball-dress. There were pearls and
diamonds at her throat, and in the wavy masses of her
hair.</p>

<p>"Who?" she asked carelessly.</p>

<p>"He did not send his card; he said to tell you a friend.
He is waiting in the private parlor."</p>

<p>Nita thought carelessly that it was one of her many
lovers come to lay heart and hand and fortune at her
feet, and get the same answer she had given others:</p>

<p>"I have no love to give."</p>

<p>She had a tender heart, but it vexed her when men
wooed her.</p>

<p>"I am no coquette. I do not encourage them. Why
will they not leave me alone?" she thought impatiently.</p>

<p>And it was on her lips to decline to see the caller. The
next moment she reflected that if she declined to-night
he would come again to-morrow. The unpleasant moment
was only deferred.</p>

<p>"I will go, I will have it over!" she exclaimed, and
took up her bouquet.</p>

<p>"I will pretend that I am in a great hurry to start to
the ball," she thought.</p>

<p>As she entered the parlor a man stood at an open window,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
breathing in the sweetness of the fair spring night.
As Nita softly closed the door he came forward into the
light, and stood revealed, tall, fair, handsome&mdash;Dorian
Mountcastle!</p>

<p>A thrilling heart-cry escaped from Nita's lips:</p>

<p>"Dorian!"</p>

<p>"Nita, my love, my bride!" cried the young man, and
caught her in his arms, straining her fondly to his throbbing
heart.</p>

<p>She did not resist him. How could she forego the ecstasy
of that embrace, the warm, intoxicating sweetness
of that kiss? For one moment she forgot the gulf between
them. Her arms crept up about his neck and
held him close and tenderly&mdash;her lips clung to his. Eden
came back for a few moments to earth again. He
pressed the beautiful form closely to his breast.</p>

<p>Ah, the gladness, the madness, after believing her dead
and lost to him forever on earth, to find her once again,
so beautiful, so tender, and so loving, alive in his arms.
He drew her at last to a seat, and whispered lovingly:</p>

<p>"Speak to me, my darling. Let me be sure this is no
dream!"</p>

<p>"No dream," she murmured happily, then asked, with
a smile. "How came you to find me, Dorian?"</p>

<p>"My love, my bride, how beautiful you are," he murmured,
"and to think that I believed you dead, drowned
in the cruel sea!"</p>

<p>She gave a convulsive start, she drew back a little
from him, the joy went out of her face. But there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
a mist of actual tears&mdash;tears of joy&mdash;in Dorian's eyes,
and he did not note the curious change on her face.</p>

<p>"Ah, Nita, how I have suffered!" he cried. "When
they told me you were dead, and that it was your wraith
I saw on the yacht that night at Fortune's Bay, I went
mad with grief. They have told me that I tried to kill
myself, that I raved like a madman. But I remembered
nothing for weary days until the reawakening to memory
of my loss. Ah, love, pardon me these wild words,
but it seemed to me that without you I was in hell&mdash;in
torment without hope of release! Then Van Hise
brought me abroad, but, oh, the long, long months of
dark despair that followed&mdash;I will not dwell on them,
my darling, now that I have found you again. And is
it not strange I was so long finding out the truth? You
must have written me, of course, love. Is it not strange
your letters did not reach me? And all the while, my
precious one, you must have been wearying for me as
I for you, is it not so, sweetheart?</p>

<p>"In Norway one night some fellows with us were
speaking of beautiful women they had met, and your
name was mentioned, my darling&mdash;your old name, Nita
Farnham. I was struck speechless with emotion, but
Van Hise, my true friend, came to the rescue. He asked
questions, he learned where you were&mdash;you and the
Courtneys. The news seemed too good to be true, but
Van Hise and I left the party and traveled night and day
to reach London, and find out if it were really my bride
given back to me from the dead. Thank God, thank
God, it is true, we are reunited never to part again!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>But, to his amazement, she drew back from his proffered
kiss, she recoiled a little from him, whispering in
a frightened voice:</p>

<p>"Do not make too sure of that, Dorian!"</p>

<p>Mountcastle threw back his handsome head with a
happy laugh.</p>

<p>"No coquetry, my darling, it is quite too late for that,"
he replied gaily. "You are all my own, you know, and
now that I have found you I shall never leave you again."</p>

<p>His arm tightened about her waist, his eyes beamed
adoring love into hers, but she trembled and gasped in
deadly fear as he held her close. She loved him madly,
adoringly, but her soul was as pure as a white rose-leaf,
and she knew that to remain with Dorian would be deadly
sin.</p>

<p>Oh, why had he found her here? why had they met
again, only to part in despair? Better if he had gone on
believing her dead, as she would, alas! be soon. No
thought came to her that it might be best to confess all
to Dorian, and ask him to help her out of her terrible
strait. She did not know that anything but death could
absolve her from her wifely vows to her husband. She
understood his malignant nature well enough to know
that he would pursue her to the ends of the earth if she
tried to escape him. And in her stainless purity she
would sooner have died than seek refuge from him in
Dorian's arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dorian, Dorian, it breaks my heart to tell you,"
she sobbed; "but&mdash;but our marriage was all a mistake,
I&mdash;I can never be your wife."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you going mad, my darling? You are my wife
already, you know," he replied wonderingly.</p>

<p>"No, Dorian, no; it was all a mistake, I tell you. I
told you always that I could never marry you while
my guardian lived. Captain Van Hise told me that night
that he was dead, and so I consented to be married. But
there was a mistake. Mr. Farnham was not dead. He
lives&mdash;he claims me&mdash;so I cannot be yours."</p>

<p>Dorian Mountcastle laughed at her childish fears.</p>

<p>"His death or his life makes no difference now," he
replied soothingly. "You belong to me alone, and no
power on earth can take you from me. Perhaps he has
some hold on your fortune. Is that what you mean?
Let him have every penny, Nita. I have enough."</p>

<p>"Dorian, words are useless. I never can be yours. We
must part."</p>

<p>He looked at her in amazement. He grew impatient
at what he considered a silly whim.</p>

<p>"I do not understand all these silly fancies, Nita," he
burst out angrily. "Perhaps you have ceased to love
me, perhaps you have repented our marriage&mdash;is it so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I repent it," she replied despairingly.</p>

<p>A flood of jealous rage poured like molten lava through
his veins.</p>

<p>"You have met some one you love better?" he cried, in
a voice so strange from excess of keen emotion that it
did not sound like his own.</p>

<p>"No; ah, no, my love, my Dorian," she moaned, and
suddenly flung herself at his feet. "Oh, I love you. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
love you. I love you," she cried passionately, as she
knelt there with upraised eyes.</p>

<p>Startled by her emotion, he stooped to raise her, but
she resisted the effort.</p>

<p>"No; let me kneel here humbly at your feet and thank
you for your love while I implore your pardon for my
weakness," she sobbed. "Oh, Dorian, there can never be
any happiness for us, dearest, while Charles Farnham
lives. If he were dead&mdash;if he were only dead&mdash;we
might be happy. I wish that he had died that night
when he was hurt. Oh, Dorian, he holds a power over
me that you do not dream of. We must part, my own
dear love, we must go our ways in life alone unless&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused a moment, and searched his face with eager
eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah, Dorian, do you love me very, very much?" she
sighed.</p>

<p>"Better than the whole world, better than my own
soul!" he answered fervently.</p>

<p>And a low sigh of gladness heaved her breast.</p>

<p>"A terrible temptation has come to me, Dorian. We
love each other so well that life apart would be worse
than death. And yet&mdash;yet&mdash;we must part. Oh, Dorian,
let us foil our malignant fate. Let us die together."</p>

<p>Surely she must be going mad to talk in this strange
fashion when there was nothing that could come between
their wedded hearts, nothing that could keep them
apart. He spoke to her soothingly, tenderly, but she only
became more wildly agitated.</p>

<p>"Do you think that I talk strangely?" she cried. "Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
Dorian, I have heard and read of lovers who died in
each other's arms rather than live apart. Let us follow
their example. A drop of poison&mdash;poison that will kill
easily, you know&mdash;and, locked in each other's arms, we
may drift together&mdash;always together, darling&mdash;into
heaven or hell, or whatever home God gives to reckless,
broken-hearted lovers. What say you, Dorian?
Shall it be so?"</p>

<p>And she gazed wildly into his horrified face.</p>

<p>Dorian gazed in mingled grief and horror at the beautiful
girl. Surely she must be mad, he thought. Then
his heart sank. Had her love turned from him in their
long months of separation?</p>

<p>Dorian had a passionately jealous nature, and the fear
of Nita's fickleness once admitted to his mind, caught
fire and burned like a devouring flame. The girl's eager,
beseeching eyes beheld all at once a strange change pass
over his fair, handsome face, and, rising, he pushed her
from him, crying out angrily:</p>

<p>"I understand you, Nita. In the months of our separation
you have wearied of me. Do not deny it, for I
will not listen to your protestations. A moment ago I
thought you must be mad, now I perceive that there is
method in your madness. You chafe at the tie that binds
us together. You would fain be free, so you pretend
this baseless fear of your guardian. Fickle heart, you
have wrecked my life! I adored you, but you found
my love only a weariness. Well, take your freedom! I
go, never to molest you again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>The white, crouching figure lifted a pallid, woful face,
and moaned:</p>

<p>"Oh, Dorian, will you leave me? Must I die alone?"</p>

<p>"Die!" the husband sneered angrily. "No, you will
live to make some other fool happy a while, as you did
me, then throw him over in this heartless fashion!"</p>

<p>All Dorian's old cynical distrust of woman's love was
returning, supplemented by jealous agony too deep for
words. It seemed to him that Nita was simply playing
a part, pretending this unreasoning dread of her guardian's
anger.</p>

<p>"Dorian, my love, forgive my weakness!" pleaded Nita
wildly; but his eyes flashed back only a limitless wrath
and scorn.</p>

<p>"Forgive you! no&mdash;not while life lasts! But&mdash;farewell
forever!"</p>

<p>Then the door opened and closed&mdash;Dorian was gone
in anger, and Nita was alone with her despair, her heart
breaking with its heavy burden.</p>

<p>Slowly and wearily she dragged herself back to her
room. She was glad the maid was not there to see her
pale, changed face and crumpled ball-gown. She closed
the door, and mechanically removed the bitter traces of
tears from her face and rearranged her dress.</p>

<p>"For I must not stay away from the ball. That shallow
Azalea would think I envied her triumph," she
thought in bitter pride, and as one goes to the stake she
accompanied the Courtneys to Lady Landon's ball, never
telling them that Dorian had sought her out, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
she had sent him away from her, reckless and broken-hearted.</p>

<p>But when Dorian read of it all in the next day's papers
that praised the beauty of Miss Farnham, the lovely
American, and told how the Earl of Winthrop had paid
her such devoted attention, he smiled in bitter mockery.</p>

<p>"It is just as I thought&mdash;there is a title in the case,
and she means to repudiate me. American girls all run
wild over coronets nowadays," he said bitterly, to Captain
Van Hise, to whom he had confided the story of
Nita's strange behavior.</p>

<p>Van Hise was frankly puzzled. He had believed in
beautiful Nita, and he would not give up his faith
yet. He remembered the night of the marriage, how
she had refused her consent until he had told her that
the old miser was dead.</p>

<p>"There is something very strange here. I honestly
believe in her professed dread of her guardian," he said
thoughtfully. "And as for the title, Dorian, you know
how we were told of her coldness and indifference to all
her suitors. No, she cares for no one but you, but she
will let her guardian's influence wreck both your lives
unless you take the matter frankly in hand. What say
you? Shall we go home to New York, and have it out
with the old miser? Beard the lion in his den, and find
out the worst of his power. You consent? Good. We
will sail this week."</p>

<p>Lady Landon's ball had indeed been a great success,
and the Courtneys were highly elated over the admiration
excited by Azalea's delicate blond beauty. Her future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
sister-in-law had been quite cordial, too, but in her secret
heart she would have preferred the magnificent Nita
with her calm manner and queenly beauty. She hinted
as much to her brother, but he told her bitterly that Miss
Farnham aspired to higher rank than a mere baronet, and
the attentions of Lord Winthrop certainly lent color to
the assertion.</p>

<p>The Courtneys were eager to return to the United
States, whither they expected Sir George Merlin to follow
them. They wanted to astonish their old set in New
York with Azalea's grand match. Then, too, Mrs. Courtney
did not desire to offend the old man who had ordered
her with no uncertain sound to bring Nita home.</p>

<p>But her charge had set her face like a flint against
returning. Rebellious and desperate thoughts were
working in the young girl's mind. Why should she
return to America? That was the question that tortured
her night and day. She had resolved to die rather
than live with her husband, and in a few more weeks the
end of the year would come. A dreadful existence
stretched before her&mdash;the price she must pay for this
year of luxury&mdash;this year that might have been almost
happy but for the madness of love that had come so suddenly
and so irresistibly into her life.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dorian, Dorian, I loved you but to lose you&mdash;yet
I cannot live without you&mdash;so I will end my life and
its sorrows," she sobbed in the sleepless silence of the
night. In her short, eventful life she had had few
chances to make real friends, and she had no kins-people
except old Meg Dineheart, who had declared herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
on that first night at Pirate Beach to be her grandmother.
For this reason Nita had protected her from
arrest for her crimes, but she shuddered and grew heart-sick
at the thought of sustaining any relationship to the
wicked old hag, and often longed for a mother's love.</p>

<p>"I am alone in the world, with no right to love and
happiness like other girls, and surely God will forgive
me for ending my wretched life," she sobbed, and began
to plan the way in which to end "life's fitful fever."</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney thought it a strange whim when, instead
of attending the opera one evening, Nita went to
church. She knew afterward the meaning of the fancy
she had combated all in vain. Nita went to church to
pray and ask God's pardon for the wicked deed she was
about to commit.</p>

<p>She smiled in mournful mockery when her worldly-minded
chaperon tried to argue her out of going.</p>

<p>"Dear Mrs. Courtney, I can take my maid; I need
not deprive you of the pleasure," she said sadly. "But
as for me, I do not care for music to-night. I would
rather hear some godly words and prayers."</p>

<p>"It is time enough for piety when you are old and
gray," the woman said cynically, and Nita gave her a
strange, sad glance.</p>

<p>"What if I do not live to grow old&mdash;if I die in my
early youth?" she queried.</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney shrugged her shoulders without replying;
but after Nita had gone out, she said significantly
to Azalea.</p>

<p>"I think she is suffering from a temporary aberration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
of the mind. You have noticed how quiet, almost morose,
she has been lately. I shall take her home to her guardian
without delay. There must be something wrong
with her mind, the way she has carried on since she
married Dorian."</p>

<p>But Nita had her way and went to church, and if ever
a tortured soul, about to launch itself into eternity, prayed
earnestly for the pity and pardon of Heaven, she did
that night.</p>

<p>And the next morning Mrs. Courtney had a shock
that she never forgot till her dying day. Nita's maid
came rushing into her room with a pallid face and staring
eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, madam, I've found Miss Farnham dead in her
bed with a bottle of poison by her side!" she almost
shrieked.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>

<h3>"YOU SHALL KNOW THE SECRET."</h3>


<p>In a shabby third-story room of a cheap apartment-house
in New York, old Miser Farnham was sitting
alone. The hideous old man was, if possible, even more
forbidding than on that day in Central Park when the
unhappy Nita had shuddered at the first sight of him,
then yielded to his temptations, and became his reluctant
bride.</p>

<p>The leering hideousness of his face a year ago was increased
now by several livid scars received in the railway
accident that had almost cost him his life, and his stooping
frame was lean and gaunt, his shabby clothing hanging
loosely on him.</p>

<p>Thin, grizzled locks straggled over his brow under
the worn old hat that he wore habitually in-doors and
out, and his keen, gray eyes gleamed with a diabolical
light of triumph as they scanned the pages of a letter
received several days previous from Mrs. Courtney.</p>

<p>"So she is coming home, my lovely bride," he chuckled
to himself. "Coming home, and it lacks barely two
weeks to the day when I shall claim her for my own. I
wonder if she has come to her senses yet, and if she
has concluded that life as an old man's darling with
unlimited cash is better than the deep, dark river."</p>

<p>"More beautiful than ever, with a score of titled lovers,"
he read from Mrs. Courtney's sycophantic letter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
"Ha, ha! to think of carrying her off from them all.
To think of marrying Juan de Castro's daughter. It is
a wonder he does not rise from the grave! Ugh! what
if he should"&mdash;and he shrank and cowered in sudden
fear, whining out&mdash;"I do not believe in ghosts."</p>

<p>The miser had one weakness. He believed in the
supernatural, and feared it. Many a night he cowered
beneath the counterpane, with his hand before his eyes,
afraid to look out into the dark lest he encounter some
menacing ghost from a wicked past.</p>

<p>The old man had reached the acme of his plans and
hopes and ambitions. His marriage to Nita had secured
things that else were doubtful. Let her but come now
willingly or unwillingly to his arms, and the triumph of
his life would be achieved.</p>

<p>He chuckled in fiendish glee, remembering these
things, and thinking of the life he would lead with Nita,
for he determined that then he would throw off his miserly
habits and live in splendor.</p>

<p>What though all New York had sneered at Farnham,
the miser, it would open its doors to the millionaire
with the beautiful bride for whom titled lovers had sighed
in vain, and with whom one of the richest men in New
York had eloped in his yacht, creating the greatest sensation
of the hour.</p>

<p>Yes, society would rave over her wealth and her
beauty; and, by and by&mdash;if she used him well&mdash;perhaps
it might be discovered that the unknown waif had descended
from rich and high-born parents. Yes, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
was just possible, if Nita should be kind to him. If
she were not, if she were not&mdash;and he ground his teeth&mdash;woe
to the heiress, her fate be on her own head.</p>

<p>Just then there came a swift and loud rat-tat upon
his door. Visitors to Miser Farnham were things unknown.
He started up, trembling. Again there sounded
a loud, impatient knock. He advanced with faltering
steps and threw open the door.</p>

<p>Before him stood two men. He had seen them both
before, and as they stepped over the threshold of the
room he confronted them with a snarl of hate.</p>

<p>"I know you both, Captain Van Hise and Mr. Mountcastle.
What is your business with me?" he queried
curtly.</p>

<p>Van Hise laughed sarcastically at this cool reception.</p>

<p>"Mr. Farnham, you certainly come to the point at
once," he exclaimed airily, "so we will not delay what
we came for. You know this gentleman, of course, as
the husband of your lovely ward, Miss Farnham?"</p>

<p>He nodded at Dorian, and the old miser scowled.</p>

<p>"I have heard of the gentleman," he said angrily.</p>

<p>"Very well. Mr. Farnham, we have come here to ask
if you have any objection to him as your ward's husband."</p>

<p>Dorian, with his hat in his hand, stepped in front of
the old man, and gazed earnestly into his face.</p>

<p>What a contrast they presented, these two, Dorian in
his fair beauty, and the grotesquely ugly, snarling old
miser.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>Van Hise's courteous question shook the old man
with jealous rage, and he asked sullenly:</p>

<p>"What can my objections matter since he is already
her husband? If the bond is a legal one, I have no
power to break it."</p>

<p>Then Dorian spoke.</p>

<p>"We know that," he said in a troubled voice, yet with
a frank, manly, half-appealing air. "Yet, strange to
say, sir, my bride stands in such mysterious fear of your
displeasure that she refuses to live with me&mdash;throws
me off as if I had no claim on her loyalty."</p>

<p>"You have seen Nita? When?" queried Farnham,
with a grin.</p>

<p>"In London, barely a week ago&mdash;our first interview
since our marriage-night&mdash;and I sailed the next day to
see you."</p>

<p>"To see me! Why? If she repudiates the marriage,
what can I do?" insolently.</p>

<p>"You can remove the mysterious barrier you have
placed between my darling's heart and mine. She loves
me, but she fears you with a strange, unreasoning terror.
She has told me that only for the report of your
death she would not have married me at all. My God,
sir! what is the secret of your malign power over the
hapless girl?" demanded the unhappy young husband
stormily.</p>

<p>Farnham glared back at him with a savage fury, as
though he would be glad to rend him limb from limb.
He put his clenched hands behind him, as though to restrain
the wild beast in him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"So you acknowledge my power over your bride?
You would like to know the secret of it?" he hissed in a
voice of exultant malice.</p>

<p>"Yes," groaned Dorian in a hollow voice.</p>

<p>And for a few moments there was silence. The miser
took a few slow, meditative turns up and down the room.
Suddenly, he turned back to Dorian, and said:</p>

<p>"You wish to know the secret of my power over
Nita? Very well. I cannot gratify you to-night, but I
will appoint a day not far distant for the important
disclosure."</p>

<p>"But, my dear sir, my friend is positively ill with suspense,
and the sooner you gratify his desire the sooner
can the barrier to his happiness be removed," interposed
Captain Van Hise suavely.</p>

<p>Farnham turned on him with a grim smile.</p>

<p>"You think the barrier can be removed, eh? We
shall see," he said, laughing sardonically; then added:
"Gladly would I gratify Mr. Mountcastle's wish to-night.
In fact, I should be delighted to do so, but I am
not at liberty to reveal the secret. I am bound by a
solemn contract not to speak of it for one year. That
year, gentlemen, expires on the tenth day of June&mdash;barely
a week hence."</p>

<p>"We must wait, then," Dorian said, with a suppressed
sigh, turning to go.</p>

<p>"One moment!" exclaimed the miser, lifting a detaining
hand as he continued:</p>

<p>"When you came in I was reading a letter from Mrs.
Courtney, in which she writes me that she will bring Nita<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
home at once&mdash;in fact, will meet me at Pirate Beach the
tenth of June, for the transaction of some very important
business between my ward and myself. Gentlemen,
I invite you also to meet me on the evening of the tenth
of June, at my seaside home, Gray Gables, at Pirate
Beach. You shall hear then, from Nita's own lips, the
story of the barrier between your hearts, and then you
can judge better if it be removable. Will you come?"</p>

<p>"We will come," they both answered in a breath, and
bowed themselves out, full of wonder and consternation,
for the old miser's manner had impressed them both with
grim forebodings.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The tide was coming in with its low, murmurous monotone,
washing the silvery sands at Pirate Beach, and
the moon was rising full-orbed and majestic, lighting
the twilight scene into weird beauty.</p>

<p>It was the tenth of June, the fatal anniversary of Nita's
marriage to the old miser&mdash;the anniversary of her meeting
with Dorian, the one love of her life.</p>

<p>Up at Gray Gables lights flashed from all the windows,
and rumor said that the travelers had come home. Far
up the beach old Meg Dineheart was pacing back and
forth, watching for her son's bark, that had been absent
several months.</p>

<p>"Will Jack ever come home again, I wonder? It
seems a year since he went," she muttered, with a touch
of forlornness, for the one affection of her lonely life
was big, burly Jack, her handsome, wicked son. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
had been expecting him now for several days, and was
growing uneasy and impatient at his strange delay. Suddenly,
a rude hand gripped her shoulder, and whirled
her around face to face with Farnham.</p>

<p>"Good evening, old lady! 'Pon my soul, you look
quite romantic star-gazing here alone," he exclaimed
gibingly.</p>

<p>"So you're back, you devil!" she hissed. "What
fiend's errand are you on now, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"To ask you to congratulate me on my success in
achieving the great ambition of my life, Meg."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean, Farnham."</p>

<p>"No, but I am here to tell you that the propitious
fates have brought to me an hour of glorious triumph,
and rewarded all my schemings with success. Come
inside the house, and let me tell you the sequel of the
story you heard one year ago to-night."</p>

<p>She turned toward the cabin, the old miser following
closely, and neither noticed that Jack Dineheart's trim
fishing-boat had come into sight, and was riding into
anchor close to shore. When the door had closed upon
the wicked pair of plotters, the sailor rowed over to
land in a tiny little boat, and sprang lightly up the beach
toward his mother's cabin.</p>

<p>"Poor old soul, I wonder if she's yet alive," he pondered.</p>

<p>And, stepping lightly to the smoke-grimed old window
of the cabin, he peered through with bated breath for a
sight of old Meg. He recoiled with a stifled cry just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Nita had done a year ago that night, for the self-same
sight met his startled eyes.</p>

<p>Old Meg and Miser Farnham were seated by a table
in earnest conversation.</p>

<p>"Humph! hatching some new mischief, I suppose,"
muttered Jack, bending his ear to a convenient knot-hole
in order to catch their words.</p>

<p>The sea boomed on the shore, the moonlight silvered
the waves, the wind sighed eerily round the old cabin,
and the words that Jack Dineheart heard that hour
paved the way for a fateful tragedy.</p>

<p>"You say that Nita has come home to Gray Gables,
yet how can that be?" cried Meg. "It was only yesterday
that I was up there, and Mrs. Hill, the old housekeeper,
was wringing her hands and crying because she
had seen in a New York paper several days old that
Nita had killed herself in a London hotel by taking poison."</p>

<p>"It was true&mdash;and false," answered Farnham angrily.
"I had a letter from Mrs. Courtney telling me all about
it. She drank laudanum, and it threw her into a deep
sleep. At first they thought she was dead, but a physician
succeeded in rousing and restoring her to life, although
she has been in a strange, dazed state ever since,
and it is thought that she may never recover from the
effects of the drug she used. But Mrs. Courtney telegraphed
me this morning that they had arrived in New
York from Europe, and would proceed immediately to
Gray Gables."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>Old Meg listened with keen interest to every word,
then exclaimed:</p>

<p>"If Nita had committed suicide in the old, wretched
days when she was my hard-worked slave I should not
have wondered at it, but it puzzles me that she should
attempt it now when she is rich and happy as old Farnham's
ward."</p>

<p>With a gulp of rage he answered:</p>

<p>"I will tell you why she wished to die. She was married
to a man she hated so much that she would die
rather than live with him."</p>

<p>"Hated that handsome swell that she eloped with? I
don't believe it. The girl loved the very ground he
walked on!" cried Meg.</p>

<p>"Yes, she loved Dorian Mountcastle, but he was not
her husband," answered the old man. "Listen, Meg,
to one of the strangest stories you ever heard."</p>

<p>And, slowly, and with infinite gusto, as though he enjoyed
the telling, he related to her the story of that day
in Central Park when he had wooed and won beautiful
Nita for his reluctant bride. She listened like one turned
to stone; not a syllable escaped her, and he ended with
ghoulish glee.</p>

<p>"As her husband all of Juan de Castro's wealth is legally
mine. I can take open possession of it now, and if
questions should be asked I can point to my bride, his
daughter, as the lawful heiress."</p>

<p>She started from her trance of silence muttering
hoarsely:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>"You&mdash;you promised to marry me when you took
possession of the spoil."</p>

<p>"Be patient, Meg. She will not live long, you ought
to know that well. You have known some people who
hated me, and then died mysteriously, did they not?
Well, this girl, this dark-eyed beauty, she loathes me, and
some day&mdash;not far distant, perhaps&mdash;I shall take deadly
revenge for her scorn. But, first, to force her to my
arms, to humble her haughty spirit, and break her proud
heart. Then your turn will come, Meg. Be patient and
wait."</p>

<p>"You are deceiving me, Farnham. You love the
daughter as you loved the mother. You will never kill
Juanita de Castro when she looks at you with her
mother's eyes. You will grovel at her feet for a word of
kindness, and Jack and I&mdash;Jack, your son, for whose
sake I crave the treasure&mdash;we will be thrust aside, forgotten!
No, no, you traitor, we will not," she rose up
and shook her clawlike hands in his face, "no, we will
not be trodden upon! We will have revenge, Jack and
I will betray you."</p>

<p>He grasped and shook her violently till the breath was
almost out of her body, then flung her roughly back into
her seat.</p>

<p>"You cat who did my bidding&mdash;you and your villainous
son&mdash;how dare you threaten me? One word from
me and you both would swing from a scaffold!" he hissed
furiously. "Hold your cursed tongue, or beware of my
vengeance!" and with an oath he left the house and took
his way toward Gray Gables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>Meg crouched like one dazed in a chair where her assailant
had flung her, but Jack Dineheart did not go in
to see if she were dead or alive. He followed the miser
almost to the gate of Gray Gables with a stealthy, sullen
stride, then, suddenly, flung himself on him with resistless
fury, and bore him down to the ground.</p>

<p>"Oh, you wretch, you devil, to have married <i>her</i>, the
girl you promised in her bonny childhood should be mine,
my wife! Oh, you fiend, to take her from me! But I
will save poor Nita and avenge myself. Here at the
gates of fancied bliss, you die."</p>

<p>A keen blade flashed in the air, then sunk in the man's
breast.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>

<h3>THE TENTH OF JUNE.</h3>


<p>It was true, as the old miser had told Meg Dineheart,
Nita had been saved from death by the skilful efforts of
a London physician, and in the stupid, weakened state
induced by the drug she had taken, and the measures
used to counteract its effects, she was like wax in Mrs.
Courtney's hands, so that she was brought home with
scarcely a protest.</p>

<p>In fact, she was so ill that during the whole voyage to
New York she scarcely remembered the old miser's existence,
and the dreadful fact that the year of her marriage-contract
was drawing to its close.</p>

<p>When she was taken to Gray Gables some glimmerings
of memory returned to her, but she did not remember
that it was the fatal tenth of June.</p>

<p>It was May when she made the frantic effort to end
her life. Since then, in the pangs of keen physical distress,
time had slipped by unheeded.</p>

<p>It was touching to see the joy of good Mrs. Hill at the
return of her beloved young mistress. She wept with
joy, and hugged Nita close to her motherly bosom, kissing
the top of the drooping little head, with its crown of
dark, wavy tresses, threaded with gold.</p>

<p>She did not say one word to her of the story she had
read in the New York paper, but when she looked into
the pale and lovely face she knew that the shadow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
some pathetic sorrow had fallen darkly on the young
girl's heart.</p>

<p>Nita lay wearily on a sofa until it was time to dress
for dinner. Then Mrs. Hill came up to help her, for
her English maid had not accompanied her home.</p>

<p>"It does not matter what I wear," she said listlessly.</p>

<p>"But Mrs. Courtney expects company this evening, I
think," said Mrs. Hill.</p>

<p>"It does not matter," the girl again replied wearily,
her eyes full of tears.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Hill had excellent taste, and she laid out a
dainty white gown for her young lady.</p>

<p>"I may be old-fashioned in my notions, but to my
mind a young girl always looks best in white, and to
you, Miss Nita, it's wonderfully becoming," she said, as
she shook out the soft, shining robe of feather-light
Lansdowne, with its profuse, airy trimmings of white,
embroidered chiffon. "This is pretty enough for a bride,"
she said admiringly. "Won't you wear your moonstone
jewelry with it, Miss Nita? It will suit you so well, and
I will bring you some pale-pink roses and white jasmine
flowers for your corsage. The garden is beautiful now,
since the gardener had it in charge. You know last
year when we first came it was all of a tangle."</p>

<p>So she rambled on, and listless Nita let her have her
way, and barely looked in her mirror when the good
woman said enthusiastically:</p>

<p>"Now you are finished, dearie. Look in the glass
what a beauty you are!"</p>

<p>She was a beauty. The soft, shining robe draped her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
form exquisitely, and the filmy chiffon rufflings made
a soft mist about her lovely half-bare neck and arms that
were clasped with moonstones, set in frosted silver, looking
soft and fairylike as linked moonbeams.</p>

<p>On her breast heaved a cluster of starry-white jasmine
flowers mixed with pale-pink, half-opened rose-buds,
making a delicate contrast of color with the whiteness
of her costume.</p>

<p>Beautiful, yes&mdash;but with a tragedy of sorrow in the
midnight eyes and on the pathetic curves of the exquisitely
chiseled lips. She smiled faintly, and murmured
some words of thanks, then went down-stairs.</p>

<p>The drawing-room, wearing a holiday air, with profuse
decorations of flowers, was deserted as yet. Azalea
and her mother were still dressing. With a sigh of relief
Nita turned her footsteps to the garden, that, under
the care of a gardener had been rescued from the tangle
of last year, and made into a fairyland of beauty and
fragrance.</p>

<p>Nita walked slowly along the graveled paths, now in
the full beams of the rising moon, now in the long dark
shadows of the tall fir-trees.</p>

<p>She paused to rest by the fountain where last year
she had come with her lover's letter in her bosom, and
her wild heart thrilling with pain and rapture. A sob
swelled her throat as she lifted her sad gaze to the star-gemmed
sky, and murmured:</p>

<p>"Dorian, my love, Dorian, it breaks my heart to know
that you are lost to me forever!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your Dorian is here, darling Nita," answered a voice
by her side, and his arm drew her fondly to his breast.</p>

<p>A low, shuddering cry, and Nita struggled out of those
fond, clasping arms, and faced her lover with startled
eyes.</p>

<p>"Dorian," she breathed, in mingled joy and pain&mdash;"Dorian,
oh, why are you here?"</p>

<p>"I followed you, my sweet. Ah, Nita, I know the
story of your mad attempt to end your life. Love, love,
why did you do it?"</p>

<p>"Fate was against us, Dorian, and I could not live
without you, I begged you to die with me, but you were
cruel. Life was more to you than love. That is a
man's way. But, being only a weak woman, I chose
death&mdash;only they were so hard they would not let me
die."</p>

<p>Her voice sank into his heart.</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor, little love. I did not believe your wild
words. How could I think you would try to end so sweet
a life?" he cried, but Nita did not reply; she only gazed
at him with the fixity of despair.</p>

<p>"Nita, I distrusted you that night. I spoke cruelly
to you. Will you forgive me my harshness, my dear
wife?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not that word&mdash;not that!" and Nita shrank and
shivered, drawing back as he approached her. "Oh,
Dorian, do not think of me, nor speak to me as your
wife ever again," she continued wildly. "Remember
that grim old man&mdash;remember Miser Farnham, Dorian.
Have I not told you I never can be your wife while he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
lives! Oh, why does Heaven permit such wretches to
walk the earth, a barrier to the happiness of true lovers?"
and she wrung her hands despairingly.</p>

<p>"Do not give up like this to your sorrow, my darling,"
he said soothingly, "for I believe that the mysterious
barrier to our happiness will soon be removed. I do not
like to fight with shadows, Nita, so after my interview
with you in London, I came to New York to see your
guardian, and ask him frankly what was the secret of his
objection to your marriage."</p>

<p>"You asked him&mdash;that?" Nita faltered in an indescribable
tone.</p>

<p>"Yes, dearest, for it seemed best to know his reasons
and combat them in a practical fashion."</p>

<p>"But he did not tell you&mdash;he dare not yet!" she muttered,
rather to herself than him.</p>

<p>"He did not tell me then, but he made an appointment
to meet me here to-night, the tenth of June&mdash;when
he said I should hear the secret, Nita, from your own
lips."</p>

<p>He never forgot the awful look on Nita's lovely face.
It was convulsed with agony and deadly fear.</p>

<p>"To-night," she muttered hoarsely&mdash;"to-night, the
tenth of June&mdash;oh, how could I forget that day&mdash;of all
days in the world? And he&mdash;is coming here to-night?"
The voice did not sound like her own.</p>

<p>"Yes, Nita; and bade me meet him here with my
friend, Van Hise, who went with me to see him. Mrs.
Courtney told me you were in the garden, so I left my
friend with her and came to seek you here. Farnham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
will be here presently, and soon the worst will be over.
Courage, sweetheart; you are my wife, after all, and
he cannot really keep us apart!"</p>

<p>But it seemed as if she had forgotten him. Her form
trembled like a reed in the wind, her eyes were fixed
upon the ground, she muttered hoarsely:</p>

<p>"It is diabolical! That old fiend has planned his triumph
with cold-blooded malice! How he will exult in
my shame and despair! I cannot bear it&mdash;no, no, no!"
And with the spring of a startled fawn, Nita flew past
her lover, a vanishing white shape, toward the garden-gate.</p>

<p>Dorian stood like one stunned a moment, then followed
in swift pursuit. But he was suddenly arrested
by an outstretched arm.</p>

<p>"Where are you flying to, Dorian?" demanded Captain
Van Hise, who had just come out to look for his
friend.</p>

<p>"Do not detain me, Van Hise. I am following Nita,
who has just fled from me in some strange alarm. She
went out at the garden-gate. Come! let us pursue her,
for I fear her terrors will lead her into something
dreadful," faltered Dorian, dragging his friend with
him in pursuit of the flying girl.</p>

<p>But the slight delay had given her the advantage of
them. She flew like the wind along the sands, flying
from the degradation that she could not face, flying to
seek refuge in the deep, dark sea from her wretched life
and its crowding ills.</p>

<p>They could never have overtaken her, she had gained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
too much the start of them, and terror lent wings to
her feet, but&mdash;suddenly she stumbled and fell prostrate
over an inert body lying directly in her path.</p>

<p>In her frenzied flight she had not perceived it, but
now&mdash;now, as she struggled to rise again, a startled cry
shrilled over her lips.</p>

<p>She comprehended the ghastly truth&mdash;here, almost at
the gates of Gray Gables, murder had been done! Recoiling
with a strangled cry, she looked down at the
body at her feet&mdash;the ugly, twisted body, the hideous
face, the evil eyes set in a ghastly stare of death. On the
instant she recognized him&mdash;Miser Farnham!</p>

<p>He was dead&mdash;murdered almost at the gates of Gray
Gables, while on his way to claim his bride, to score
his horrid triumph and break two loving hearts. It was
a dastardly deed, and fate or retribution had met him on
his way.</p>

<p>But who had done that awful deed? Some enemy, of
course&mdash;perhaps the wicked old fortune-teller. But,
though she trembled and shuddered, it came to her with
a thrill of joy that now she was free&mdash;now Dorian need
never know the secret of which she was so bitterly
ashamed&mdash;that she had been for one cruel year a wife
in name to the wicked miser.</p>

<p>She would fly back to the house&mdash;she would steal up
to her own room and remove the white dress with its
blood-stains where she had slipped and fallen on the
body. No one should know that she had found the murdered
man there.</p>

<p>With a stifled moan she turned to retrace her steps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
and&mdash;ran almost into the arms of the two men coming
in pursuit. In the near distance they had seen her kneeling
there, they came up just as she turned to fly.</p>

<p>"Who is this? What is this?" cried the soldier, bending
down over the body at his feet.</p>

<p>Nita answered with a hysterical sob:</p>

<p>"Look, I found him lying here when I was flying to
cast myself in the sea. It is&mdash;it is&mdash;my guardian&mdash;and
some one has&mdash;murdered&mdash;him!" with the last words she
shuddered violently, and fell unconscious at Dorian's
feet.</p>

<p>He lifted her up in his arms, and his hands were wet
with the blood-spatters on her white gown&mdash;the bridelike
robe that looked so stainless when she stood there by the
fountain a few minutes ago.</p>

<p>"I will carry her up to the house, Van Hise, and you
had better remain here by the body until I send some
one back to help remove it," he said, in a shaken voice,
turning away.</p>

<p>At that moment there appeared on the scene the hobbling
form of Meg, the fortune-teller. After a few moments
of unconsciousness she had come to herself in
the lonely cabin, and curiosity had induced her to follow
the old miser up to Gray Gables.</p>

<p>She stopped short with a shrill cry, and, stooping
down, examined the dead, drawing back with a shudder
as her hand became wet with blood.</p>

<p>"Ugh! it is the old miser&mdash;and murdered! Who has
done this?" she croaked dismally.</p>

<p>Van Hise explained to her that he did not know anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
about it, that Miss Farnham found the body there
but a moment ago.</p>

<p>"And it is not more than half an hour since he left
my cabin alive and well, going up to Gray Gables to
keep an important appointment with Nita," croaked the
old woman. She looked after the retreating form of
Dorian, and sneered:</p>

<p>"Perhaps she grew impatient and came out to meet
the old man, did she not?"</p>

<p>"She came out alone, certainly, but for what purpose
I cannot tell," answered the puzzled soldier, who had
never seen old Meg before, and he added:</p>

<p>"I know nothing about the matter except that she
was very unhappy and excited, and my friend and I followed
her as fast as we could, fearing she might commit
some desperate deed."</p>

<p>"Some desperate deed, ha, ha! yes, and so she did!"
shrieked the old crone, in horrid glee. "She met the old
man she feared and hated, and she murdered him&mdash;murdered
him so that he should not betray her secret!"</p>

<p>"Woman, woman! how dare you utter such a fiendish
lie!" exclaimed the soldier angrily.</p>

<p>He sprang forward as though to strike her down, but
she eluded him, and drew a glittering knife to defend
herself.</p>

<p>"Lay but a finger on old Meg, and you will be stretched
out there by the miser's side," she menaced, and again
laughing a horrible laugh, she continued:</p>

<p>"She murdered him, I say it again, and before twenty-four
hours go over her head she shall lie in prison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
for her crime! Ah! she thinks her secret safe now, but
barely an hour ago he told me she had been his wife in
secret for a year, and that he was going there to claim
her to-night!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Stiff and stark in his last long sleep, Miser Farnham
lay in his coffin awaiting burial&mdash;this was the end of his
plotting and planning&mdash;his scheming and sinning.</p>

<p>The inquest was over, and Meg Dineheart, as chief
witness, had hounded the hapless girl she hated to a terrible
fate. Circumstantial evidence had pointed so
strongly to Nita as the slayer of the miser, that she had
been consigned to prison to await trial for murder.</p>

<p>There were few who could believe in the young girl's
innocence, for the evidence against her was so overwhelmingly
strong, and the motive for the murder so
plain. And there were not lacking witnesses to prove
that the girl had been desperate with despair and misery.</p>

<p>The Courtneys were the first to turn against her, and
as witnesses they did their worst. They could tell the
story from the beginning of Nita's falling in love with
another man, and her fear and hatred of the miser; they
could tell of the elopement, of the return, and of Nita's
desperate despair and frantic grief when she learned
that the miser had survived the dreadful railway accident.
They could dwell with telling effect on her wickedness
in encouraging Dorian's love when she was another
man's wife, they could dilate on the attempted suicide
in London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>All their stifled hatred of the girl who had benefited
them could be aired now, and without one word of pity
for her sorrows, they became old Meg's able allies in
hounding her to her doom.</p>

<p>Even Dorian and Captain Van Hise had been compelled
to give damning evidence against Nita. They had
found her kneeling and then trying to escape from the
murdered man's side, her dress and her hands all wet
with the blood.</p>

<p>And there was no one else near, no one until old Meg
had appeared. All the evidence given at the inquest had
pointed straight to Nita's guilt, and there seemed but one
extenuating circumstance&mdash;it seemed as if she must have
suffered for months from emotional insanity.</p>

<p>In a moment of madness, enraged by the knowledge
that her husband had contrived a cunning plot to expose
her secret and humiliate her in the eyes of the man she
madly loved, she had met the old man coming to Gray
Gables, and in her blind rage sprang at him and murdered
him.</p>

<p>The weapon had not been found, but it was decided to
have been a very keen-bladed knife, and there were two
wounds in the region of the heart that must either one
have proved instantly fatal.</p>

<p>Doubtless she had thrown the knife away, although
careful search had failed to find it. But that was not
strange. The encroaching tide, of course, had carried it
out to sea.</p>

<p>Only three friends rallied round her, only three hearts
believed in her innocence&mdash;they were Dorian, Van Hise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
and kindly Mrs. Hill. It was this only that saved her
from utter heart-break.</p>

<p>With Dorian to believe in her still, Dorian to love her
and champion her cause, there was still a little gleam of
light in the awful darkness of her fate.</p>

<p>And Dorian, when he engaged the best lawyer in New
York to defend her, had told him that he was willing to
sacrifice his fortune and his life in her defense.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, I am not guilty&mdash;I am not guilty!" she cried
piteously, lifting her great, appealing eyes to the face of
the great lawyer, as he entered her gloomy prison-cell.</p>

<p>"I shall prove your innocence&mdash;be sure of that," he
answered kindly, and then he bade her speak to him
without reserve, confiding all her story to his sympathy,
that he might best judge how to defend her cause.</p>

<p>And Nita opened all her sad young heart freely and
without reserve. From early childhood, as far back as
she could remember, her home had been with old Meg,
at her rude cabin by the seashore, an unwilling, ill-treated
drudge, beaten and cuffed at every small rebellion of her
proud spirit.</p>

<p>At length she grew to girlhood, and then Jack Dineheart,
old Meg's son, began to persecute her with offers
of marriage. She hated Jack, and at fifteen years old
ran away to New York to escape his persecutions.</p>

<p>Providence watched over the friendless girl, and she
soon found friends, poor, but kind, who took her into
their shabby home, and helped her to find work.</p>

<p>For three years she struggled on bravely, first as a
nurse-girl, then in a store, as a cash-girl. Then the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
old man who, with his kind wife, had befriended her,
fell sick and died. His wife, old and feeble, soon followed
him to the grave.</p>

<p>Nita left the store to attend these sick friends, and
the usual lot of the poor in a great, struggling city, fell
to her share. Every penny gone, the few sticks of furniture
taken for rent, she was turned into the streets,
starving and friendless. She could find no work; she
was too proud to beg, so she resolved to end her sorrows
in the river.</p>

<p>"I lingered in Central Park watching the gay throngs
so rich and happy, while I was starving and miserable.
I had resolved not to die until sunset," she told the lawyer.
"I clung to life, but I was afraid of a night in the
streets of the great city, and I was too timid and ashamed
to ask strangers for assistance. Then I met the old
miser just as I had murmured a desperate prayer for
gold. He offered to marry me, and at first I refused.
But he finally told me that if I would consent he would
give me a chest of gold, and draw up a marriage-contract
giving me perfect liberty for one year. I consented;
but, oh, sir, I was deceiving him&mdash;I never meant
to live with him. I only caught at the chance of a little
longer life, and luxury that I craved, but had never
known."</p>

<p>The lawyer listened to her in the deepest pity, drawing
her out with skilful questions. He thought he had
never heard anything more pathetic than the story of
her love for Dorian, told so frankly and sadly as though
he had been her father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>"And have you no relatives, my child?" he asked, and
she told him that old Meg had once said that she was
cast up by the sea from a wreck, and had afterward
claimed to be her grandmother.</p>

<p>"But I do not believe her. My heart shrinks in loathing
from that wicked woman. I believe that she and
Mr. Farnham knew all my past story, and all about my
relatives," added Nita passionately.</p>

<p>"I think you are right, and I shall leave no stone unturned
to ferret out the truth and punish the real murderer,"
said the lawyer; and when he took his leave he
left a little ray of hope shining like a star in the heart
of the beautiful prisoner in her lonely cell.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h2>

<h3>THE OTHER CLAIMANT.</h3>


<p>The sensation was three days old before it came to
Donald Kayne's knowledge. He had been out on one of
his favorite yachting expeditions. Wild, restless, moody,
he loved the sea, with its fierce unrest. It seemed like
his own nature, restless and stormy.</p>

<p>He came back to New York, and, taking up a newspaper
at his club, was attracted by some sensational
headlines at the top of a column, and proceeded to read
the whole story with breathless interest.</p>

<p>It came upon him like a terrible shock. Within the
hour he was on his way to Pirate Beach. When he
came in sight of Gray Gables, he beheld a funeral cortège
moving away from its doors. Miser Farnham was
being borne to the graveyard to his eternal rest, followed
by old Meg Dineheart as chief mourner.</p>

<p>By the side of the old woman rode her son, the burly
sailor who had come into port a few hours previous, and
professed to be quite shocked at the news of the murder.</p>

<p>To several persons he professed profound regret, saying
that the miser had been a lifelong friend of his
mother, and had often befriended himself, having made
him a present of his little fishing-bark.</p>

<p>Donald Kayne watched the funeral procession winding
its solemn way along the sands, then rode on to Gray
Gables to see the Courtneys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>They met him with effusion. They had much to tell
him of that shocking girl, Nita; how badly she had treated
her old husband, and how she had deceived poor Dorian
Mountcastle. And they did not fail to tell him of
Azalea's engagement to the titled Englishman, who was
soon to follow her to the United States.</p>

<p>Donald Kayne listened eagerly to everything. At the
end of it all he offered Azalea his polite congratulations,
and asked if Dorian had turned against Nita, or if he
believed in her still. When they told him that Dorian
believed in her still, and had employed a lawyer to defend
her at the trial, his face changed, and he said
warmly:</p>

<p>"Dorian was always noble."</p>

<p>Then they tried to draw him out, to find out what
he thought of the case, but he would not say one word
either way. He was entirely non-committal. They were
piqued, remembering his old enmity against Nita, and
his threats of revenge. Surely he ought to rejoice now
at the proud girl's fall.</p>

<p>"Where is Dorian now?" he asked, and they told him
that Dorian and Captain Van Hise had taken quarters
near the jail where Nita was confined, that they might
visit her every day. They had tried to get her out on
bail, but had been refused.</p>

<p>"You have been to see her?" he asked, knowing well
what the answer would be.</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Kayne, a murderess!" and Mrs. Courtney
lifted her aristocratic hands in dismay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>"That remains to be proven, you know!" he said quietly,
and arose to take leave.</p>

<p>They pressed him to remain, but he told them he wanted
to see old Meg again. He might return in the evening.
He went slowly through the grounds, haunted
by the memory of the apparition he had seen on his last
visit to Gray Gables. Was it real, or a phantasm of a
tortured fancy? He could not decide.</p>

<p>"Oh, Pepita, Pepita! only to unravel the mystery of
your fate, and the mystery of your flight, what would I
not give?" he groaned.</p>

<p>He loitered on the lonely shore. The surf rolled up
to his feet with a hollow murmur, and receded. Far off,
the tapering white sails of an outwardbound ship glimmered
on the horizon like a fading hope, and was lost to
sight.</p>

<p>He was well armed this time, and carried a goodly
store of gold, believing that both were necessary to the
success of his mission to old Meg. Suddenly, the sunset
light faded out, and the sky grew dark with storm-clouds,
while a fast-rising gale began to toss the waves
into hurrying foam.</p>

<p>"Ah! a little bit of a storm. I must hasten my steps,"
he thought, and walked on briskly, but it grew dark ere
he reached the cabin, and the sound of voices from the
open doorway arrested his steps.</p>

<p>"She is talking to some one. I will wait," he decided,
drawing back, and then he heard:</p>

<p>"If we play our cards well, Jack, she will certainly
be hanged, and we can manage to claim all the money."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>"But what about the other claimant, mom?&mdash;the woman
you told me of that came here almost fifteen years ago
in search of the little Nita, that you hid until she was
gone? What if she turns up and unearths the whole
plot? She would get all, for old Farnham said she was
Juan de Castro's own sister."</p>

<p>"She will never turn up, Jack, for she followed the
miser up to Gray Gables, and I believe he murdered her,
for she has never been seen since, and there was a man
here not many months ago who offered me untold gold
if I would tell him aught of the missing woman."</p>

<p>At those portentous words from the old fortune-teller
to her son, Donald Kayne reeled backward with a smothered
cry of agony.</p>

<p>For almost fifteen years a little spark of hope had
glowed faintly in his heart. Surely, surely, he would
some day find the woman once so madly loved and so
strangely lost out of his life!</p>

<p>Alas! old Meg's revelation to her son had trampled
out the last spark of hope. No need of his gold to buy
her secret now. It was his for nothing.</p>

<p>So Pepita had come to Pirate Beach in search of a
child&mdash;of Nita? What was the child to her that she
had risked so much and suffered death for its sake? In
learning so much of the missing woman, Donald Kayne
had stumbled upon another mystery. Old Meg had spoken
of a plot. Who were the actors concerned in it?</p>

<p>She had spoken of a treasure, too, that she and her
son might claim if Nita were hanged. What was it?
Where was it? And who was Nita? No one could believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
that she was anything to the old wretch who had
accused her to the authorities of the miser's murder.</p>

<p>His thoughts flew to the hapless girl at whose feet he
had prayed in vain for the secret of the serpent-ring.
His mind grew clearer now, and seemed to pierce the
mystery.</p>

<p>The miser had murdered Pepita&mdash;so Meg believed.
Then he had given Nita the serpent-ring, and no doubt
bound her by a promise not to betray the giver.</p>

<p>And Pepita! What had been her fate? Where was
she now? Were her unburied bones whitening in some
unknown vault at Gray Gables? It came to him suddenly
that it must be so, for that night when she had appeared
to him she had vanished into air against the basement
wall.</p>

<p>"She is there, and I will pull down every stone in
that old house but what I will find my darling," he
groaned, and as these thoughts flashed through his mind
he heard Jack Dineheart continuing:</p>

<p>"A man offered you money for the secret, you say?
I hope you were not such a fool as to betray it."</p>

<p>"Not I&mdash;I was too sharp for that," grinned Meg, and
then Donald Kayne knew that but for the information
he had gathered by accident, he would never have been
able to learn the secret of Pepita's fate.</p>

<p>He silently thanked Heaven that had sent him there so
opportunely to hear the conversation that was not intended
for his ears. He lingered, hoping to hear more,
but the lowering storm-clouds suddenly poured out a torrent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
of rain, and Jack, muttering a curse on the elements,
arose and shut the cabin door.</p>

<p>Donald Kayne, drenched to the skin, staggered away
from the place, buffeted by the mad elements, but almost
unconscious of it all in the excitement of his mind.</p>

<p>He was thinking profoundly of all that he had heard,
and muttered fiercely again:</p>

<p>"I will tear down every stone at Gray Gables but
what I will find my darling, and give her poor bones
decent burial, so that at last she may rest in peace in her
lonely grave."</p>

<p>Heedless of the warring elements, and with his heart
on fire with pain, he trudged on toward his hotel, not
caring to claim the hospitality of Gray Gables in his present
drenched condition.</p>

<p>The secret he had just heard had given a new, remorseful
impetus to his thoughts. They were painfully
divided between Pepita dead and Nita living. What
connection was there between the two women, and what
wrong had Nita suffered at the hands of the old miser
and Meg? Therein lay a mystery he longed to fathom.</p>

<p>A great revulsion had come over him. He had persecuted
Nita and avowed himself her enemy. He realized
now that he had wronged an innocent, helpless girl by
his cruelty and hasty judgment.</p>

<p>How nobly she had behaved toward him. To no one
had she confided the story of her imprisonment at Fortune's
Bay; no one dreamed but that it was Jack Dineheart
who had saved her life and brought her home. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
her silence when revenge was in her power she had nobly
punished her foe.</p>

<p>"May Heaven help me to atone and win her pardon,"
he prayed.</p>

<p>And at the earliest hour permissible on the morrow
he went to the prison.</p>

<p>To the last hour of his life he never forgot the thrill of
pain at his heart when he first beheld Nita sitting in
that dejected attitude with her dark head bowed so wearily,
and her small hands folded in her lap. The serpent-ring
still gleamed on her wasted finger; but it woke no
anger in him now, only intense emotion.</p>

<p>She rose mechanically at his entrance, but no smile lit
up the sadness of her great dark eyes. She knew him
only as her foe; she believed that he had come to exult
over her misery.</p>

<p>But just as he had knelt to her a year ago Donald
Kayne knelt now, and bending his proud head, kissed the
hem of her gray gown.</p>

<p>"Nita&mdash;Miss Farnham&mdash;I crave your pardon for the
past," he murmured humbly.</p>

<p>She was so taken by surprise she could only stare at
him with parted lips, from which there came no speech,
and he continued:</p>

<p>"I deserve no pity from you, I know, but my heart is
torn with remorse for my fault, and the desire of my
life is to prove my repentance for my sin. I hope, too,
that I may be able to serve you in your undeserved
trouble. Will you&mdash;can you pardon the past, and be my
friend?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>The heavy eyes grew brighter, and she held out her
little hand.</p>

<p>"I forgive you, and I am glad to be friends with you,"
she answered nobly, and it seemed to him she was more
angel than woman. He sat down beside her then, and,
after thanking her, with moist eyes, for her goodness,
made her his confidant in the affair of last night, ending
frankly:</p>

<p>"I came here to ask you if you will permit me to explore
Gray Gables, in the hope of finding out what I
have sought to know so long. I tell you frankly I have
sworn to pull down every stone in that old house, but
that I will find Pepita. But I am very rich, Nita, and if
I tear it down I will rebuild it again."</p>

<p>She gazed at him with eager, sympathetic eyes, and
answered:</p>

<p>"What you have told me, sir, makes me believe that I
have been the victim of a foul wrong at the hands of
old Meg and Farnham, and since he is dead now there
can no longer exist any reason for the silence I swore
to keep over his secret. I will confide to you the story
of the serpent-ring."</p>

<p>And then and there she told him of the day when she
had lost her way in the dark old corridors and blundered
upon the miser's secret&mdash;the gold-vault and the
skeleton-woman.</p>

<p>She never forgot his smothered groan of despair when
the awful story had been rehearsed. It haunted her long
after he had gone, and her heart was so full of pain that
in sympathy for him she almost forgot her own sorrows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>At length Dorian came to make the brief daily visit
permitted by the authorities, and then she told him of
her visitor, and his overtures of friendship.</p>

<p>Dorian frowned darkly at first when she spoke of his
old friend and later foe, but Nita said in that sweet, irresistible
voice of hers:</p>

<p>"Dorian, I forgave him, and so must you, dear."</p>

<p>"It is impossible&mdash;&mdash;" he began, but one look from
the tender eyes stopped his speech.</p>

<p>"It is not impossible, Dorian. Why, you forgave me
for deceiving you so dreadfully, and so you can forgive
him, too. Only think what he suffered, and how frantic
he must have been over my seeming obstinacy. But now
he repents everything, and I know from what he said
that he is going to help find the real murderer if he can.
And, dear, he used to love you and you loved him. Ah,
Dorian, won't you make up your quarrel with him, and
be at peace? If you love me, do not refuse me."</p>

<p>She coaxed until he promised to seek Donald Kayne
and resume the old friendship; then she gave him her
whole confidence, and he knew at last how the men on
Kayne's yacht had saved her life the night she and Lizette
had been washed overboard by the stormy billows.
He was most indignant when he learned that she had
been imprisoned at Fortune's Bay, but again her soft
entreaties stemmed the current of his wrath.</p>

<p>"He was mad with grief and pain, do not forget that,
Dorian, nor his repentance now," she murmured, with
sweet forgiveness.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</a></h2>

<h3>HER FATHER'S NAME AND GOLD.</h3>


<p>"But poor Lizette, did you ask him what had been her
fate?" asked Dorian anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes, he told me that Lizette jumped out of the window
and sprained her ankle so badly that the doctor said
she would not walk for months, so he was compelled to
leave her at the Rhodus house. They promised to take
the best of care of her, and he gave her money to pay
them and to come back to Pirate Beach when she was
able to travel. That is the last he has heard of her, but
he will write and make inquiries. Oh, Dorian, I miss my
good Lizette very much. She loved me dearly, and she
would be such a comfort to me now, for since my trouble
I do not seem to have but one woman friend, good Mrs.
Hill, the housekeeper at Gray Gables."</p>

<p>"And she is a noble old soul, and her friendship is
worth having," said Dorian. "But, darling, you will have
two more kind friends soon, to stand by you in your
trouble. You know I have no near female relatives, but
Van Hise has a mother and sister, two of the noblest
women in New York, who believe in you so thoroughly,
and have such sympathy for you, that they have written
him they are coming down here to-day to remain until
after your trial, and help you to bear your trouble. Shall
you like that, my darling?"</p>

<p>The tears were in her eyes as she listened to him. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
had felt so lonely, so deserted, as if the whole world
were against her; and the desertion of the Courtneys,
their rancor and malice, had cut deeply to her heart.</p>

<p>She had been so good to them; she had loaded them
with gifts and favors, and though she knew they did not
love her, she had not believed them capable of such heartlessness
as they had displayed in persecuting her, and yet
staying on so coolly at Gray Gables without the shadow
of a right.</p>

<p>Dorian and his soldier friend were most indignant.
Van Hise told Nita frankly that as the widow of Charles
Farnham, Gray Gables was her own property, and she
ought to turn the Courtneys out. But Nita was too noble
for paltry revenges. Somewhere in the blood of this
girl, whose ancestry was yet unknown, ran a strain of
blue blood.</p>

<p>"No, let them stay," she said. "If I could stoop to
revenge myself for their treachery I should be as low and
base as they are. Besides, I do not forget that the dear
Lord is watching over me. I leave all in His hands."</p>

<p>And Captain Van Hise could say no more, but he
thought admiringly:</p>

<p>"Jupiter, what a queen she is, and how proud Dorian
must be of this grand creature!"</p>

<p>But the tears of joy came into her eyes when Dorian
told her of the true woman friends who were on their
way to her side.</p>

<p>"Now I love them already!" she cried fervently, and
when they came she leaned her weary head on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
motherly breast of the elder woman and sobbed like a
weary child.</p>

<p>"I have never known a mother's love," she said, and
Mrs. Van Hise answered tenderly:</p>

<p>"You shall never miss it again, dear."</p>

<p>"And I will be your sister," added Lena Van Hise,
with sympathetic tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>She was a beautiful, slender, sixteen-year-old girl, and
Nita, who was not yet nineteen, felt her whole heart
attracted to her. In that dark and gloomy prison-cell
there began that day a friendship that would last to the
end of both their lives.</p>

<p>It was one of the proudest and happiest moments of
Donald Kayne's life when Dorian sought him out and
proffered anew the firm friendship that had been broken
off by their quarrel and the duel. Tears stood in the eyes
of both as they clasped hands, and Donald Kayne said
huskily:</p>

<p>"I do not deserve this noble forgiveness from you and
Nita, but I will do my best to deserve it."</p>

<p>"I am sure you will," was Dorian's hearty reply, for
he knew his old friend's sterling worth.</p>

<p>Nita had given the unhappy man such minute directions
as to finding the narrow stairway and closed door
leading to the gold vault at Gray Gables that he did not
think it would be necessary to pull down the old mansion,
as he had vowed to do. He confided freely in Dorian and
asked him to accompany him on the quest, saying
frankly:</p>

<p>"With the gold that Nita saw in the chest I have nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
to do. Doubtless it is the treasure referred to in
old Meg's confidences to her son, and of course it belongs
to Nita. We must keep the secret of it most carefully
until such time as she is ready to take possession of it.
But in the woman whose dead body rests unburied in the
vault I have a painful interest, the secret of which I will
later confide to you. But until her poor bones are laid
in the grave and her restless spirit is appeased, I can
know no rest or peace."</p>

<p>"Her spirit!" whispered Dorian Mountcastle, in awe.</p>

<p>"Yes, she walks, for I have seen her in the grounds at
Gray Gables, and she vanished into air against the basement
wall. Poor Pepita, she was trying to lead me to
her hiding-place then," groaned Donald Kayne.</p>

<p>"How strange it seems that our chief purpose now is
to find and punish the murderer of Farnham, although
there is no doubt but that the old villain met a well-deserved
fate."</p>

<p>"I believe the guilty party is the wicked old fortune-teller,"
said Donald Kayne, and Dorian and Captain Van
Hise, who were present, agreed with him.</p>

<p>"But we can find neither evidence of her crime nor
any motive for it. She has proved, indeed, that she was
his lifelong friend," added Dorian dejectedly, for the
utter failure to find the least clue to the murderer of
Miser Farnham depressed him very much.</p>

<p>He knew how terribly dark was the circumstantial
evidence against Nita, and his soul rebelled against the
only verdict by which it seemed possible she could
escape conviction&mdash;emotional insanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will not believe that even in a moment of insanity,
driven mad by her troubles, she could have committed
such a terrible deed!" he cried over and over, but yet all
the evidence pointed to Nita's guilt, and all the detectives
he had set to work could not find a clue to the murderer,
nor a single scrap of evidence on which to hang a warrant
for charging old Meg with slaying her friend the
miser.</p>

<p>Meantime the days flew by, and in less than a week
the trial was to come off. There were strong, brave
hearts working loyally in Nita's cause, and yet they
quailed with fear.</p>

<p>The three friends decided to go that day to Gray
Gables to search for the vault, but they determined to
take no one into their confidence. It would not be safe
to let the hiding-place of the miser's gold be known. As
they walked toward Gray Gables they met Mrs. Courtney
and her daughter promenading on the sands. Both
were elaborately attired, and looked self-satisfied and
happy.</p>

<p>Azalea met them with joyous smiles, and detained them
several moments in friendly conversation, but when they
had passed on the dimpling smiles faded from her face,
and she said angrily:</p>

<p>"I hate them all for taking that girl's part and believing
in her after all the evidence that proved her guilt."</p>

<p>The three friends proceeded to Gray Gables, and it was
a perfectly easy task to induce Mrs. Hill to let them go
into the room which Dorian had occupied during his illness
there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>They locked the door, lighted a lamp, and proceeded
to explore the corridors according to Nita's careful directions.
Soon success crowned their efforts. The little
narrow stairway was easily found, but the door at the
foot resisted their efforts at first, but at last the bolts and
bars yielded, and it burst asunder.</p>

<p>She was there waiting for them&mdash;poor Pepita, in the
ghastly grimness of death! Dorian and Van Hise reverently
drew aside the coarse gray blanket that covered
the skeleton in the chair, and when Donald Kayne saw
what remained of the beautiful woman once so madly
loved, he fell in a swoon upon the floor.</p>

<p>It was some time before he was restored. Then he was
like one dazed. He knelt by the chair with his head on
the table, and sobs shook his strong frame.</p>

<p>Ranged around the walls were a dozen strong cedar
chests heaped to the lids with Spanish gold coin. Upon
a steel plate on the end of each chest was engraved the
name: "Juan de Castro."</p>

<p>Nita had told them of the attempt that old Meg had
once made upon her life, and the name by which she had
called her then: "Juanita de Castro."</p>

<p>They looked significantly into each other's face.</p>

<p>"Her father's name and her father's gold," uttered
Captain Van Hise, and choked back a sob at thought of
the girl who, having been cheated out of her heritage of
wealth and love, had been driven to despair by lack of
bread.</p>

<p>"Some dark and hideous mystery lies back of all this,"
he said to Dorian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>And the young man answered sternly:</p>

<p>"And the key to it all lies, perhaps, in the hands of
Meg Dineheart, the fortune-teller. Let us search carefully
and perhaps we may find papers to throw some
light on the mystery. If not, the strong hand of the law
must be raised to force Meg to a full confession of the
sin that deprived Nita of her heritage."</p>

<p>They searched carefully, but not a scrap of writing
rewarded their efforts. After an hour they decided to
leave the place for the time, taking with them the bones
of the murdered woman. A roll of white silk that Donald
Kayne had brought was wrapped about the skeleton, and
he bore it in his arms to Dorian's room, where it was
decided they should leave it until night, when it might
be carried away unseen.</p>

<p>Then Dorian turned the key in the lock as they went
out and dropped it in his pocket. He knew that Mrs.
Hill would not object to his keeping it till night.</p>

<p>"Let us go at once to old Meg and force her into
betraying the secret of Nita's parentage, and the whole
conspiracy by which she has been so terribly wronged,"
suggested Captain Van Hise.</p>

<p>Dorian and his friend agreed, and they set off at a
brisk pace for old Meg's cabin, determined to unearth
the mystery if possible. But they were entirely ignorant
of the fact that, while they were exploring the gold-vault
at Gray Gables, the Courtneys had returned to the house,
and that Azalea by accident had witnessed their departure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>Burning with curiosity, she flew to her mother with
the story.</p>

<p>"There is something mysterious on foot surely," she
said vindictively, and added, "I mean to get into that
room and find out what Dorian Mountcastle has locked
up there. I should like to get hold of some disgraceful
secret of his and expose it to the world."</p>

<p>"Fie! fie! Azalea! that would not be ladylike!" answered
her mother.</p>

<p>"I don't care, so that I get revenge on Dorian for the
way he has treated me!" cried the jealous girl, eager to
punish the lover who had found her out and scorned her.</p>

<p>"You had better let well enough alone," cried the
more prudent mother, who was beginning to feel uneasy
over their abandonment of Nita. She knew well that she
deserved to be turned summarily out of Gray Gables, and
feared to precipitate the blow by any interference in
Dorian Mountcastle's affairs.</p>

<p>"I don't care what you say, or whether you help me
or not, I'm going into that room and find out Dorian
Mountcastle's secret!" she burst out excitedly.</p>

<p>"Very well, Azalea, but take my advice and send that
meddlesome old housekeeper away on some errand first,
for I know she hates you, and would be delighted to
have something to tell Dorian about you," Mrs. Courtney
answered coldly.</p>

<p>It did not take Azalea long to despatch Mrs. Hill, and
then, armed with a bunch of keys, she proceeded on her
errand. The door soon yielded, and with a little chuckle
of triumph she glided in and closed the door, but without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
locking it, for she knew well that her mother was
hovering near, consumed with secret curiosity.</p>

<p>Azalea wandered from object to object, but her eager
eyes encountered nothing strange until by accident her
glance roved over the bed. Then she saw the outlines
of a long slender object beneath the coverlet.</p>

<p>"Pshaw! I won't be a coward!" she muttered, and
thrust out a shaking white hand and turned down the
covers.</p>

<p>Something lay there swathed round and round and
round in folds of soft, thick white silk.</p>

<p>And catching hold of an end of silk, began to unwind
it with rapid hands.</p>

<p>Another moment, and a startled shriek rent the air.
Mrs. Courtney, tiptoeing outside, opened the door and
darted in, horrified at her daughter's shrill scream of
terror.</p>

<p>Upon the bed she beheld the ghastly skeleton.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</a></h2>

<h3>DONALD KAYNE'S STORY.</h3>


<p>All unconscious that Azalea had penetrated their secret,
the three men pursued their way to the fortune-teller's
cabin. But they were doomed to disappointment. The
place was deserted, the doors locked, the small windows
securely boarded over.</p>

<p>Evidently Meg had gone away, and, judging from the
preparation made, intended to be absent some time. And
yet that could not be, for Nita's trial would come off in a
week, and she was one of the witnesses for the prosecution.
Chagrined and baffled, they sat down on the low
bench before the cabin, wondering what they should do
next.</p>

<p>It was a dull and gloomy day, the sea was rough, and
the tide rolled in to the shore with a hollow, reverberating
moan. They watched it with sad eyes and heavy
hearts, each busy with his own thoughts. Suddenly
Donald Kayne spoke:</p>

<p>"My friends, I am minded to tell you my story."</p>

<p>They looked into his face. It was pale and wan with
a great despair, and his voice faltered as he continued:</p>

<p>"You and I, Dorian, have been friends for ten years,
ever since you were a boy of sixteen, in fact. You, too,
Van Hise, have known me for years; but it was before I
met either of you that I lost my darling wife!"</p>

<p>"Your wife!" cried Dorian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, Pepita was my wife," said Kayne, "my wife
dead to me now for almost fifteen years, yet with the
mystery of her fate unsolved till yesterday. Is it not a
wonder I have escaped madness?"</p>

<p>They could not reply save by mute looks of sympathy.
Their feelings overpowered them.</p>

<p>"I will tell you how I first met her," he continued
dreamily, with his sad eyes fixed on the sea. "It was on
Broadway. I saw a beautiful, young, dark-eyed girl
crossing the street in such a careless, preoccupied fashion
that she only escaped death from the hoofs of an advancing
team by the celerity with which I sprang forward
and dragged her out of the way. As it was, she had
been thrown down and trampled on, and as I laid her
down on the pavement I at first believed her dead. She
was dressed in costly garments, made in a quaint, foreign
fashion that, with her dark eyes and hair and olive skin,
proclaimed her Spanish. A crowd gathered around, but
no one could tell who she was, so, as she remained unconscious,
a physician was called, and she was removed to
the hospital.</p>

<p>"The hoofs of the horses had severely injured the poor
girl, and she remained at the hospital several weeks. I
saw her daily, for it is needless to tell you that the first
moment I saw her I lost my heart. I won Pepita's
friendship, and she told me she was a Spanish girl, an
orphan, who had come to America from old Madrid to
seek an only brother in New York, only to find him dead.
Of this brother she told me a romantic story. On attaining
his majority, some years before, her brother had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
come to America, and had met in New York a beautiful,
poor girl, whom he made his bride. On taking her home
to Spain his proud parents had refused to receive their
son's choice, and in anger he returned to America, never
to see them again.</p>

<p>"In a few years misfortune overtook them. They became
poor and miserable, and longed for the son they
had cast off in their pride. They died, and their only
remaining child, beautiful Pepita, crossed the seas to
find her brother. On the day that I saved her life she
had just learned that her brother and his wife were both
dead. Despair made her reckless. Alone and friendless
in a strange land, with but a few dollars in her purse, she
wandered along, wondering if she could ever return to
her native land.</p>

<p>"The tears blinded her as she crossed the street, and
she did not notice that she was under the horses' heads
until they trampled her beneath their feet. You guess
the end, my friends. I married the lovely Spanish
stranger, although my friends blamed me, and for a year
we were blissfully happy. We traveled several months,
and it was in Paris I had the serpent ring made especially
for her and the design destroyed. She had a great fondness
for unique trifles, and I always gratified her fancy
to the utmost in everything. We returned to this country,
and over our home Pepita reigned a lovely queen,
seeming not to have a wish ungratified. Our happiness
seemed as pure and perfect as mortals could enjoy.</p>

<p>"Suddenly as a thunder-bolt falling from a clear sky
my happiness came to an end. My wife left home one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
day in my absence and never returned. Oh, God! how
did I ever live through it? The shame, the horror, the
agony! For the world sneered and said I had married
unwisely, and that my darling had fled from me with
some favored lover. I could not believe it, although her
maid told me she had received a letter that had agitated
her very much, and that she had gone away directly
afterward, saying that she intended to spend the day
with a friend. I had gone to Boston at the time, and
when I returned two days later I found that she had not
returned, and that the city was ringing with the news of
her flight. I employed detectives. I almost wrecked my
health in the vain search for her, for I would not believe
there was anything guilty in her flight. No&mdash;no, I was
too sure of her love and truth for that. But, alas! the
days and weeks and months lengthened into weary
years, and there came no news of the lost one, nor even
the faintest clue until that night you remember, Dorian,
when I first saw Pepita's ring on Nita's hand, and almost
went mad over her refusal to tell me how she came by it."</p>

<p>"I can no longer wonder at your passionate vehemence!"
answered Dorian gently.</p>

<p>"Yes, think of what I suffered from her refusal. I
knew not if Pepita were dead or alive&mdash;until this spring,
when, lingering one twilight hour in the grounds at Gray
Gables, my lost wife appeared to me in spirit-form and
led me to the basement wall, where she disappeared. Ah,
then I knew at last that my darling was dead, and I
know now that she was seeking to lead me to her hiding-place
in the miser's gold-vault."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>The listeners were silent. Could it be true, or was it
but a vision of superstitious fancy? Donald Kayne would
always believe that he had seen a spirit from another
world.</p>

<p>When they all grew calmer, they agreed that he had
been right in believing his wife was faithful. It must
have been a decoy letter that had called her away, perhaps
some promised news of her brother or his child,
although Pepita had never spoken of any child.</p>

<p>"She fell into a trap set for unwary feet, and was
murdered, although for what cause we may perhaps
never know unless we can wring the secret from old
Meg," said Donald Kayne.</p>

<p>The rest of the day was spent in making very quiet
and private arrangements for removing all that remained
of Donald Kayne's young bride from Gray Gables and
conveying it to New York, where the unhappy man
wished to have the interment in his family vault.</p>

<p>"And after I have solved the mystery of my darling's
death the world that wronged her so cruelly by its base
suspicions shall know the truth," he said bitterly.</p>

<p>They made arrangements with Mrs. Hill to come back
at midnight, having taken her into their confidence
regarding the finding of the skeleton. She was full of
interest and sympathy, and they found her waiting in the
dark to admit them into the house.</p>

<p>"Every soul is asleep but me," she whispered, and they
went noiselessly to the room where they had left the
shrouded skeleton on the bed, Mrs. Hill waiting at the
front door for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>They closed the door, struck a light, and turned to the
bed.</p>

<p>The white coverlet was drawn up as they had left it,
and the slight outline of something was visible beneath.</p>

<p>Donald threw down the cover and lifted the bundle of
white silk in his arms. He laid it down again, turned
back a fold of silk and looked within.</p>

<p>A cry of horror came from his lips. Some one had
taken away the skeleton and left the bed-bolster in its
place.</p>

<p>Dorian brought Mrs. Hill to the room, and they talked
in whispers of the strange loss. The housekeeper soon
jumped at a conclusion.</p>

<p>"I believe the Courtneys have done this," she said.
"They came in to-day while you were shut in here, and
maybe they saw you go out and suspected something.
I will tell you why I think so. Azalea came to me soon
after, as sweet as sugar, and got me to go to the druggist's,
a mile away, on a silly little errand for some
cosmetic she wanted. I expect she wanted to get me
out of the way so she could ransack the room in my
absence. It is nobody but she that has taken it away and
hid it for spite, I'm sure of that! Don't make any outcry
for a few days, please, gentlemen, and don't let her
know you suspect her, and I'll watch the little cat and
find out where she has hidden it away."</p>

<p>It seemed best to follow her advice, and they went
away together, heavy-hearted enough, for fate seemed
to baffle them at every turn. But they hoped much from
Mrs. Hill, for they did not believe that Azalea could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
taken the skeleton away from the house, and it seemed
as if she must surely be detected in her wickedness by
the espionage of the clever housekeeper.</p>

<p>Tears fell from Nita's eyes the next day when Dorian
told her all that had happened, and added:</p>

<p>"All the evidence points to the fact that poor Pepita
was your own aunt, and must have met her death seeking
for you."</p>

<p>"Surely, surely Miss Courtney could not be so vile as
to secrete those poor remains," she cried indignantly.</p>

<p>Dorian gave one of those cynical laughs of old, and
answered:</p>

<p>"Azalea Courtney is vile enough for anything. She
has no more heart or soul than a stone, and her only
god is herself. She would like to have the whole world
fall down and worship her, and no words can describe
the virulence of her hate toward any one who discovers
her true character and despises her as she deserves."</p>

<p>"And she is one of the witnesses against me. She will
try to hound me to my doom!" cried Nita.</p>

<p>"Yes, she will certainly do all she can against you,"
admitted Dorian. "But you need not fear her malice,
my darling. She cannot harm you, for Heaven itself is
watching to defend you!" and he smiled at her cheerfully,
for he had the greatest faith that a fitting retribution
for all her wickedness would yet come to Azalea.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the jealous beauty was already suffering
the punishment for her curiosity, for her nerves had
been so shocked by the finding of the skeleton that fit
had succeeded fit, and for several days she was quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
ill from the effects of her scare, and talked wildly in her
dreams of the terrible thing, fancying herself a bride, in
white-silk robes, about to be wedded to a skeleton, and
often screaming out wildly in her sleep.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Courtney kept the secret of Azalea's illness
carefully to herself, and gave out to the servants that
her daughter was suffering from a persistent headache.
Only Mrs. Hill suspected what was the matter, and
laughed in her sleeve at thought of the fright Azalea
had received.</p>

<p>"It was good for her, the sly cat, and I wish it had
turned every hair of her head white when she found it!"
she said to herself, chuckling with delight over Azalea's
discomfiture.</p>

<p>But outwardly good Mrs. Hill was very solicitous over
the young lady's welfare, and quite won over Mrs. Courtney
by her kind inquiries. In truth, that lady was glad
of the courteous manner of the housekeeper, for there
had always been furtive enmity between them, and the
interloper feared lest it might now come to open warfare.
She knew that she had now no shadow of right at Gray
Gables, and that after the antagonism she had displayed
toward Nita, she should in common decency have taken
her departure from the place.</p>

<p>But since her poverty had fallen on her she had developed
what Mrs. Hill slangily called "a very hard cheek,"
and she was determined to stand her ground until she
was ordered to leave. Knowing how noble and high-minded
Nita was, she had no fears of being thus dispossessed,
and stayed coolly on, looking every day for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
the advent of Sir George Merlin, who had promised to
soon follow his betrothed across the water.</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney had contrived to make the baronet believe
her a rich woman, and she had no mind to let him
find out the imposition until he had married Azalea. But,
in the meantime, the question of Azalea's trousseau became
an all-absorbing thought. Where could they get
the wherewithal to purchase it?</p>

<p>They had jewels, but they did not want to sacrifice
them, and they could not expect anything more from
Nita. She was becoming very despondent over it when
her daughter's discovery of the hidden skeleton put a
clever idea into her head. She hid it away carefully,
believing that a handsome ransom would be offered for
its recovery.</p>

<p>Several days passed, but, to her chagrin, no notice
seemed to be taken of the disappearance of the skeleton,
so she decided to write a blackmailing letter to the parties
concerned in secreting it, threatening them with
arrest by the authorities unless they paid a large sum for
its return. The epistle was signed by a fictitious masculine
name, and arrangements were made for the payment
of the money in a way by which the receivers need
not be detected. Unless the sum demanded was forthcoming
in a week the authorities would be informed, or
the skeleton would be destroyed.</p>

<p>Dorian Mountcastle was the party to whom this precious
epistle was sent, and he decided not to inform Donald
Kayne of its receipt until after he had held an
interview with Mrs. Hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>"Make no reply to it," advised Mrs. Hill. "I am
almost certain that Mrs. Courtney has got it concealed,
and as soon as her daughter gets well enough for them
to go out riding together I will make a careful search
for it. She will not destroy it, for she hopes to get money
for it; neither will she inform the authorities, for that
would defeat her hopes of gain. Only keep silent, and
trust all to me, and, I will promise, you shall have it
back safe. But don't tell Mr. Kayne about the blackmailing
letter, for it would excite him so much that he
would probably gratify Mrs. Courtney by giving her the
thousands she is after."</p>

<p>Dorian thanked her gratefully for her faithful interest,
and promised not to let Kayne hear anything of the
blackmailing project, for he was anxious to defeat the
Courtneys if he could.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.</a></h2>

<h3>LIZETTE A PRISONER.</h3>


<p>Donald Kayne had told Nita the simple truth when he
said that Lizette's sprained ankle was so severe that she
had been obliged to remain for long months at Fortune's
Bay. But, to do him justice, he had made every possible
arrangement for her comfort and happiness during
her long stay at the Rhodus house.</p>

<p>He had provided liberally for every luxury she might
desire, sent her a stock of books to read, and of materials
for fancy-work, and, having thus provided for her
comfort, he made one private stipulation with Fisherman
Rhodus and his wife. This condition was that any
letters Lizette might write should not be posted, although
when she became well enough no embargo was to be
placed on her liberty. She was to be permitted to leave
the island and return home.</p>

<p>But long and weary were the months before the poor
maid could walk, or even stand, upon her foot again.
And harrowing was her anxiety over the fate of her
young mistress, whom she had last seen borne away in
the arms of the sailor. She loaded herself with reproaches
for her own credulity that had betrayed Nita
into the power of her enemy.</p>

<p>But soon there came to her a letter from Pirate Beach
that set her mind at rest. Donald Kayne, after meeting
Nita, had thought kindly of poor Lizette's anxiety, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
himself wrote her a short letter informing her that the
dreaded sailor had indeed kept his promise of returning
her mistress to her friends, and that Nita had now gone
abroad with the Courtneys, to be absent for an indefinite
period.</p>

<p>Lizette's mind thus happily set at rest, she became
more cheerful under her great affliction, and within the
next three months Jack Dineheart made his appearance
at the Rhodus house and humbly begged her pardon for
the accident he had caused.</p>

<p>Jack was a good-looking specimen of a sailor, and
could be very ingratiating when he chose. He was an
intimate friend of the Rhodus family, and it pleased him
to make a friend of the pretty, plaintive maid in the
lonely old prisonlike house.</p>

<p>He swore to her solemnly that the fall of the ladder
had been an accident, but fearing it had made enough
noise to awaken the family, he had decided not to risk
returning for her lest he should imperil the safety of her
mistress. His story was so plausible that Lizette could
not refuse to believe it, especially as Donald Kayne corroborated
Jack's story that Nita had been returned to her
friends.</p>

<p>So pretty Lizette readily forgave the smooth-tongued
sailor who, in common with his craft, had the knack of
winning his way to a woman's heart.</p>

<p>Jack was often at the island that winter, and when he
could overcome the gruffness he often affected, and
leave liquor alone, he was always a welcome guest at the
Rhodus house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>He even tried to make love in a rough way to the
pretty creature who sat so helplessly in the great arm-chair
with her wool-knitting in her lap, and had to be
waited on by everybody.</p>

<p>Lizette was not averse to his attentions. They lent a
little spiciness to the dull days, and so she let a little
coquetry creep into her looks and words, just a little
kittenish mischief that amused them both, and made old
Rhodus and his wife wag their gray heads knowingly, as
if to say:</p>

<p>"That will be a match."</p>

<p>In the spring days, when Lizette's sprain began to
mend, she promised Jack that on his next trip she would
go home with him to Pirate Beach.</p>

<p>"For I took your mistress safely back there, and I
sha'n't feel right until I deliver you safe, too," he said.</p>

<p>So it happened that Lizette sailed with him in that
golden June time back to Pirate Beach, her heart full of
joy at the thought of a reunion with her beloved Miss
Nita.</p>

<p>"But somehow, Lizette, I feel like you may be disappointed.
I don't believe she has ever come home from
Europe yet," Jack said to her, as they sat together on
deck that twilight hour of the tenth of June, as they were
nearing the familiar shores of New Jersey. "Tell you
what, old girl, suppose we don't land at home unless she
is up at Gray Gables. We'll drop anchor near the beach
and I'll go over to mom and see if the folks are back.
If they are not we can go on up to New York and have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
a lark. You said there was some one there you wanted
to see, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if they're not dead, for I've written and written
and got no answer," returned Lizette, with an anxious
look in her soft-blue eyes. So it happened that Jack's
bark came to anchor near the shore, and Jack rowed over
alone in the twilight to seek his mother.</p>

<p>Lizette waited a while on deck, but as the wind freshened
and the waves began to put on white-caps, she grew
nervous and went into the tiny cabin to talk to the
woman who did the cooking and mending for the very
small crew.</p>

<p>Presently the woman went off to attend to some small
duty, and then the maid sat down by the light with a
book and began to read to pass the time away.</p>

<p>She had just reached a very thrilling point in her novel
when a stumbling step made her look up, and&mdash;Jack
Dineheart was by her side.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack, what is it?" cried the young woman, in
dismay, for as he sank into a seat by her side she saw
that his face was ashy white, his eyes wild, his frame
trembling.</p>

<p>"It is nothing, you foolish girl, nothing. Go get me a
drink of whisky," he answered hoarsely, and put up his
hand to shield his face from her inquisitive gaze.</p>

<p>Then, indeed, a shudder ran through all her frame, and
she cried in sickening terror:</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack, what have you been doing? There is blood
on your hand&mdash;wet blood&mdash;and blood on your sleeve!"</p>

<p>With a frightened oath the man looked, and found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
her words were true. His hand was red with blood, and
so was his light coat-sleeve.</p>

<p>For a minute they gazed at each other in startled silence.
His eyes were wolfish&mdash;hers frightened, questioning.
A moment, and he broke through the spell that held
him, with an uneasy laugh.</p>

<p>"Good Lud! don't look so scared," he cried roughly.
"I'll tell you the truth, Lizette. My arm's hurt&mdash;a shark
bit at me in the little boat, and I had a tussle to get
away. I didn't mean to tell, only you saw the blood.
Now don't tell any one, will you? See here, Lizette, I
won't allow any tattling"&mdash;roughly. "I'll go wash the
blood off and get a drink; and you'll hold your tongue,
you hear?"</p>

<p>"Very well, Jack," Lizette answered, with dignity, offended
by his rough, menacing manner; then she caught
at his coat as he was turning to go, and asked eagerly:</p>

<p>"But, Miss Nita, Jack? Is she up there at Gray Gables,
or not?"</p>

<p>"No, she has never come back from Europe, so we
will go on to New York, as we planned, and have a jolly
good time; but, mind, Lizette, not a word about the shark
and the blood, or I'll cut off the end of your tongue!" and
Jack wrenched himself free, and disappeared.</p>

<p>Lizette wept with disappointment because she should
not see her mistress yet.</p>

<p>"But I'll spend a few hours in New York, then go
back to Pirate Beach and see Mrs. Hill, and find out all
about Miss Nita," she thought, as she threw herself on
her bunk, and sobbed herself to sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>When she awoke again she found herself a prisoner in
a low den by the river-side in New York, guarded by a
fiendish-looking old woman, who thrust some coarse food
inside the door, and disappeared without answering a
word to her imploring questions. Jack Dineheart was
nowhere to be seen, but in a few days Lizette was horrified
to find that his mother had taken the place of the
mute attendant.</p>

<p>"Meg Dineheart, what does this mean?" she demanded
angrily, but with a jeering laugh Meg vanished, and she
heard the key grate harshly in the lock of the door.</p>

<p>"Oh, what is the mystery of this strange persecution?"
wondered the half-maddened prisoner, forebodingly, but
all her fears for the future did not approach the reality
of the awful fate that hung suspended over her head
ready to fall and destroy her very life.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.</a></h2>

<h3>ON TRIAL FOR HER LIFE.</h3>


<p>When the day of Nita's trial approached the popular
verdict had adjudged her guilty. It was believed that if
the jury cleared her it would only be to send her for life
to an insane asylum.</p>

<p>Azalea Courtney and her mother read the papers with
deepest interest, they exulted in every harsh criticism
aimed at Nita, and they hoped that she would get the
severest sentence.</p>

<p>"If she is spared to be Dorian's wife, I shall hate her
even more bitterly than I do now," asserted Azalea vindictively.</p>

<p>"I thought you had gotten over your passion for Dorian,
now that you are going to make such a grand
match," her mother returned uneasily.</p>

<p>Azalea was lounging on a sofa, the picture of indolence.
She raised herself on her elbow and looked into
her mother's face with a spark of fire leaping into her
large blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Dorian Mountcastle is the only man I ever loved, or
ever shall love," she answered, "I shall marry Sir George
of course, but I shall love Dorian as long as I live. I
thought that time when I threw him over that I should
soon forget, but I was young, and did not realize the
power of love. Fancy then how horribly I hate Nita,
whom he loves so dearly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Somehow I think it would have been more to our
interest if we had taken her part and hidden our hatred
in our own hearts," said Mrs. Courtney. "Soon we shall
be turned out of doors penniless, with no claim on her
pity or protection."</p>

<p>"But, mama, you will get the ransom for that&mdash;thing,"
returned Azalea, growing pale at the memory of her
fright.</p>

<p>"I am not so sure of that. There are no answers to
my letters."</p>

<p>"Then, mama, it may not be as important as we
thought. We had better destroy it before we are suspected,"
cried Azalea, unconscious that a woman listening
at the keyhole gave a start of dismay.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will burn it, and keep the white silk for your
wedding-gown," said Mrs. Courtney thriftily, unheeding
her daughter's shudder.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'll never need a wedding-gown, mama. I
have not had a letter from the baronet for two weeks.
He only proposed to me to pique Nita, you know, and
he may intend to back out of the engagement now."</p>

<p>"If he does he will have a suit for breach of promise
on his hands," exclaimed Mrs. Courtney viciously, and
the woman listening outside the door sneered as she
grasped closer in her hands a thin, foreign-looking letter,
bordered and sealed with black.</p>

<p>Then she retreated a few paces, gave a loud cough,
and, again advancing, rapped on the door and delivered
her letter.</p>

<p>"Good Heavens, mama! a London letter in mourning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
And, see, it is in a strange hand&mdash;a woman's! What can
it mean?"</p>

<p>"Open it, Azalea, and see!"</p>

<p>Her daughter obeyed, exclaiming in another moment:</p>

<p>"Sir George's sister, mama&mdash;Lady Landon&mdash;oh, mama,
this is terrible. Sir George was thrown from his horse
two weeks ago, down at his country place, and fatally
injured, dying in a few hours. He never spoke, never
was conscious again&mdash;so farewell to all my ambitious
dreams! Fate has baffled me again."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hill, who had taken the liberty of lingering, now
had to help bring Azalea out of a fit of hysteria induced
by the failure of her brilliant prospects. Mrs. Courtney
dismissed the housekeeper, and began to comfort her
daughter.</p>

<p>"Don't grieve any more over it, my dear. Fortunately
your affections are not hurt in the least."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but it's the money and the position I've lost&mdash;that's
what I'm thinking of, mama."</p>

<p>"It can't be helped now, and I have another plan&mdash;if
all goes well."</p>

<p>"What is it, mama?"</p>

<p>"Azalea, you know that old Farnham was very rich.
Now, if Nita should be&mdash;ahem&mdash;executed for his murder&mdash;who
is to inherit all that money?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, mama. Perhaps that old fortune-teller
will try for it."</p>

<p>"She will be disappointed. I shall claim it myself&mdash;or,
rather, you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mama, you must be crazy!"</p>

<p>"Not at all, my dear, but I have a secret. Miser Farnham
was your father's half-brother, older than your
father, the black sheep of the family, and disowned by all
his kin. Why, barely sixteen years ago that old man
was the master of a smuggling vessel&mdash;a dishonest craft,
so strongly suspected of piratical tendencies that she was
seized and sunk by the authorities. Then old Farnham
gave up his seafaring life, and became a scamp on land
as he had been on sea. But I needn't bore you with a
recital of his rascality. Suffice it to say he was closely
related to the Courtneys, although we never had any reason
to be proud of the relationship. But now that he is
dead you are your uncle's heiress; if Nita&mdash;ahem&mdash;dies,
it will come to you&mdash;the wealth he has hoarded so long&mdash;and
even if she is cleared, you can sue for a share unless
he has made a formal will and left her the whole property."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It seemed to Nita that she could not live through her
trial; as if she should fall dead of her shame and despair
when she was led into court that morning to meet the
curious faces of the dense crowd.</p>

<p>But there was Dorian, with his encouraging smile, and
there was Mrs. Van Hise, with her tender, motherly ways,
and Lena, with her steadfast heart; Donald Kayne, too,
and Captain Van Hise, with Colonel Harlow, her lawyer&mdash;all
these true friends were there, and by their love and
faith helped her to bear her terrors bravely, and not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
mind the dark, glowering faces of Meg Dineheart and
her son as they sat ready to swear away her life.</p>

<p>There was one thing that surprised her&mdash;the absence
of Mrs. Courtney and Azalea. At the inquest over the
dead miser these two had done all in their power, told all
they knew against her, and she had been told that they
would be witnesses for the prosecution.</p>

<p>When she whispered her wonder to Mrs. Van Hise, the
cheek of the good lady turned slightly pale, and she whispered
hurriedly:</p>

<p>"They may have been detained, but I see that Mrs.
Hill, the kind housekeeper from Gray Gables, is here.
Perhaps she will explain."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hill had nodded and smiled in the most endearing
fashion at her favorite, but her kind heart sank at
the pale, sad looks of Nita. The long weeks of close confinement
those sweltering summer days had told sadly
on the young girl's health and strength.</p>

<p>Her cheeks were wasted with sorrow and washed pale
with tears, her dark eyes were heavy and downcast, her
lips pathetic in their weary, wistful droop. Her black
silk costume, plain and close-fitting, was nunlike in its
simplicity, and had no relief of color except some roses,
the gift of Dorian, that she carried listlessly in her small
white hand where the serpent-ring still glittered in its
baleful splendor.</p>

<p>She had offered the ring to Donald Kayne, but he had
refused to accept it.</p>

<p>"Keep it for Pepita's sake, and think of her kindly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
sometimes, for I believe it was for you she lost her life,"
he said huskily, and Nita tearfully put the splendid jewel
back upon her finger. But the old terror of it was gone
now, and she thought often and tenderly of the woman
who had owned it, and whose tragic fate had saddened
the life of Donald Kayne.</p>

<p>Pale and trembling with the horror of her awful position,
Nita sat, the cynosure of hundreds of curious eyes,
some of them soft with pity, others harsh with blame.
She shuddered as her thoughts went back over her short
life, so full of sorrows, and with so little sunshine in it.
Dorian loved her&mdash;that was the only gleam of brightness.
With that thought she looked timidly at him, and the
world of love in the eyes that returned her gaze thrilled
her heart with joy.</p>

<p>And, meanwhile, Colonel Harlow had begun to argue
his client's case. The grave jury and the eager crowd
hung upon the words that fell from his lips.</p>

<p>But the lawyer for the prosecution, who was young,
and had his spurs yet to win, had a slightly sarcastic
smile on his lips. Colonel Harlow was great, he knew,
but he could not clear the prisoner by a brilliant speech
unless he had evidence to show that some one else had
committed the crime, and Lawyer Field was certain
that such evidence was not to be given. So he listened
with a smile, and grew impatient for his own turn, when
he expected to eclipse Colonel Harlow's oratory and convict
the prisoner. In his own mind he felt certain of her
guilt.</p>

<p>Colonel Harlow spoke effectively for several hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
and then the examination of the witnesses began. They
were few, but they were so rigidly cross-examined that
it took a long time.</p>

<p>Eagerly every one watched Dorian's pale, harassed
face, as he gave the testimony he was not permitted to
withhold. Nita choked back the rising sob lest it should
grieve him, but after he and Captain Van Hise sat down,
and were followed by old Meg and her son, it seemed
to the girl as if she were already condemned.</p>

<p>Lena Van Hise was sobbing bitterly by her friend's
side, unable to restrain her emotion. She believed with
Nita that the evidence of those four witnesses would be
fatal. Lawyer Field was certain of it, too. He smiled
to himself as he watched Colonel Harlow's pale and troubled
face.</p>

<p>"He feels certain of his defeat," decided Fields exultantly.</p>

<p>He did not know what a sensation was to follow
upon the call for the next witness.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Courtney!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Hill, the housekeeper from Gray Gables, rose in
her place to announce that the witness was dead.</p>

<p>"Dead!"</p>

<p>And a murmur of uncontrollable excitement arose.
When it had been quelled she was asked when the witness
had died, and the answer was given that she had
met her death the night before in leaping from the window
of Gray Gables, which had been partially burned to
the ground.</p>

<p>"Miss Azalea Courtney!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Courtney had been saved from the burning house
by the brave exertions of the firemen, but was so badly
burned she would not be able to come into court for
months, if ever.</p>

<p>Nita's white face dropped into her hands, while she
stifled a cry of horror. Gray Gables almost burned to
the ground, Mrs. Courtney dead, Azalea injured&mdash;how
dreadful it was. Her heart thrilled with pity for her relentless
foes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hill was a witness, too, and her loving testimony
to Nita's goodness made the girl's heart beat warmly
again&mdash;love and praise were so dear to her sad heart,
even from this humble source.</p>

<p>She looked away from the angry, glowering eyes of
Jack Dineheart and his mother, and fixed her gaze on
the kind face of the good woman, who, although the
cause of the burning of Gray Gables did not come exactly
under the head of evidence, managed to give the
listeners the benefit of her theory.</p>

<p>Mr. Kayne had left a skeleton secreted in the house,
and the Courtneys had stolen and hidden it, hoping, by
their blackmailing efforts, to receive a large ransom for
it. Failing in their designs, and fearful of detection, they
had attempted to destroy their prize by fire, resulting in
the disaster by which the mansion had been destroyed,
and both women injured, the elder one fatally.</p>

<p>As for the skeleton, she, Mrs. Hill, had discovered its
hiding-place several hours before, and assisted Mr.
Kayne to remove it to a place of safety.</p>

<p>Nor did Mrs. Hill forget to give the gaping public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
the benefit of the sensation it received in hearing of the
death of Miss Courtney's titled lover across the sea.</p>

<p>Fate had baffled the pretty plotter at every point, and,
penniless and friendless, even her beauty, the weapon on
which she prided herself so much, now totally destroyed,
she was nothing now but an object of pity and charity
to those whom she had sought to wrong.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Hill's highly sensational evidence was all
in she was permitted to resume her seat, and the court
announced that all the witnesses had been examined and
the speech for the prosecution would begin.</p>

<p>At that moment Colonel Harlow arose to say that he
had another and very important witness yet, and from the
expression of his face the lawyer for the prosecution
began to feel rather nervous.</p>

<p>"The new witness," announced Colonel Harlow, "is
Miss Lizette Brittain, a former maid of Miss Farnham,
who has been missing for some time, but has turned up
just when most needed."</p>

<p>When Nita saw the face of Lizette again she half-rose
in her seat, with a cry of joy.</p>

<p>Lizette gave her a loving smile in return, and a reassuring
nod.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a></h2>

<h3>THE PARRICIDE'S FATE.</h3>


<p>Meg Dineheart and her sullen son did not care to stay
in to hear the new evidence. They were trying to slip
quietly away, but an officer, all unconsciously to the guilty
pair, had been quietly guarding them both, and they
were informed in a curt whisper that they must remain.</p>

<p>With sullen looks of baffled rage the conspirators sat
down again, and Lizette, who was looking very pale
and ill, although resolute, began her story.</p>

<p>She told of her return to Pirate Beach on Jack Dineheart's
bark the tenth of June, and of how he had gone
over in the row-boat to see his mother, returning soon,
pale, agitated, and bloody, with the story of the shark
that had bitten him in the water, and the falsehood that
Nita had never returned from abroad. She dwelt on
his taking her to New York, and her inexplicable imprisonment
there for no reason that she could discover.</p>

<p>"Little did I dream," continued the maid, with tears
in her eyes, "that my dear mistress was on trial for murdering
her husband, and that Jack Dineheart was keeping
me shut up, knowing that as soon as I heard about it I
would denounce him as the murderer, for I never did
believe that shark-story he told me. But I was in no
danger of ever finding out the awful truth, imprisoned as
I was, if a kind friend had not interested himself in my
fate. Mr. Donald Kayne had promised my mistress to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
send for me, and then he learned that I had sailed for
home on Dineheart's ship. He learned that Dineheart
had landed at New York, but when he sought the sailor
and asked him for me, he was told I had died, and was
buried at sea.</p>

<p>"Not believing the story, Mr. Kayne placed a detective
on the sailor's track, and then he decided to murder me
so as to escape espionage. He and his mother bound
me, while drugged, to a railroad track, believing I would
be killed, but they had been followed by the detective
and Mr. Kayne, and as soon as the sailor and his mother
left me I was rescued and taken to a place of safety.</p>

<p>"That was last night, and when Mr. Kayne told me
of the awful plight of my dear mistress, I knew that God
had spared me to save her life, for I know&mdash;and God
knows&mdash;that it was Jack Dineheart who murdered the
miser that evening of the tenth of June, when he went
ashore at twilight and came back with that white, scared
face, and the blood on his hand and sleeve."</p>

<p>Mr. Fielding, the lawyer for the prosecution, knew now
that he had no case, that the prisoner at the bar was innocent
of crime, for Jack Dineheart and his mother, terrified
at finding themselves in the power of the law, confessed
everything, and begged for mercy.</p>

<p>And a cruel and disastrous plot was laid bare when
they revealed the secret kept so long, under threats of
death from Miser Farnham, should they dare reveal it.</p>

<p>In his character of a well-to-do ship's captain, Farnham
had been an unsuccessful suitor for the hand of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
beautiful American girl that the rich Spaniard, Juan de
Castro, had married.</p>

<p>Hiding his chagrin Farnham had vowed a bitter vengeance
on his rival, and the opportunity came to him
within a year after the marriage. Juan de Castro was
very rich in his own right, having inherited the estates of
a millionaire uncle, and when his parents looked coldly
on his choice of an American bride, he swore in bitter
anger that he would never look on their faces again, but
return and become an American citizen.</p>

<p>Converting all his wealth into money, he stored it in
a dozen chests and secured transportation for it on the
vessel of his wife's pretended friend, Captain Farnham.
The young pair embarked for New York, but on the
voyage the young mother, after the birth of a daughter,
died, and Farnham murdered the unhappy young widower,
and pretended that he had committed suicide while
in a frenzy of grief at the loss of his wife.</p>

<p>The babe was cared for by a sailor's wife until they
reached Pirate Beach, when he placed it in the care of
old Meg, whom he had promised to marry.</p>

<p>He stored the stolen gold in the cellar of his old house,
Gray Gables, and kept its hiding-place a secret, but he
promised that Jack should marry the little Juanita when
she grew up, and become master of the great treasure.</p>

<p>Later, when the murdered man's sister, Pepita, came
to America to seek her brother, the miser, fearing she
would detect his villainy, had sent her an anonymous letter,
acknowledging her little niece's existence, and promising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
if she would come at once, and secretly, to deliver
Juanita into her hands.</p>

<p>She went, fell into the spider's web, and met death in
the gold-vault, from whence her bleached skeleton had
now been removed, to rest in a consecrated grave.</p>

<p>When Jack Dineheart, listening at his mother's door
that night, first learned that his fiend of a father had
married the girl promised in her infancy to his son, he
had gone mad with jealous rage for himself, and honest
pity for the lovely girl doomed to fall into the power of
her father's murderer. To avenge his own wrongs and
to save Nita from a fiend, Jack Dineheart had slain his
father.</p>

<p>The miserable parricide and his whining old mother
were led away to prison to be tried for Miser Farnham's
murder, and for conspiracy against the life of Lizette
Brittain.</p>

<p>A few months later the old fortune-teller was sentenced
to imprisonment for life, and her son was condemned to
be electrocuted.</p>

<p>Long before the sentence of death was executed the
prisoner became violently insane, and, attempting to murder
one of the wardens in the prison, was shot dead.</p>

<p>Old Meg, whose affections had been centered on Jack,
after his death never held up her head, dying very suddenly
one day, when she had been in prison barely two
years.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Hise had made a charming discovery. When
Meg Dineheart had mentioned the name of Gertrude
Vaughan as that of Nita's mother, the lady had given a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
start of surprise, and made a few abrupt inquiries of the
fortune-teller. Later she said fondly to Nita:</p>

<p>"I have a claim upon you, after all; my maiden name
was Vaughan, and from what Meg told me I have discovered
that your mother was a cousin of mine whose
acquaintance I had never made. So, Nita, dear, you
belong to me until Dorian claims you."</p>

<p>"Which will be to-morrow, if Nita will consent," exclaimed
the happy lover.</p>

<p>"She will not consent, for she has to order her trousseau
first, and I shall take her home with me to-morrow,
and she will not be ready to be married until late in the
winter," laughed Mrs. Van Hise, determined to hold on to
her lovely cousin as long as possible.</p>

<p>They all went up to New York the next day, but before
they went all arrangements were made for Azalea
Courtney's comfort. Nita went herself to the hospital
where the burned and disfigured girl would have to remain
many months.</p>

<p>But the heavy hand of affliction had not softened nor
sweetened Azalea's temper. She had heard how the trial
had turned out, and her heart was full of disappointment,
hate, and jealous envy.</p>

<p>"I suppose you have come here to exult over my misery!"
she said bitterly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Azalea, how can you think me so cruel? I am
sorry for you; I came here to help you."</p>

<p>"I suppose you think me poor and came to give me
money, but I have startling news for you," Azalea returned
angrily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>"News, Azalea!"</p>

<p>"Yes. You think yourself heiress to all Miser Farnham's
money, but my mother told me the day before
she died that old Farnham was my own uncle, and that
I ought to have a share in his wealth, so I shall employ
a lawyer and sue you for a division of the spoils," said the
disfigured beauty, with angry triumph.</p>

<p>"You will not need to sue, Azalea, for all of the miser's
possessions that can be discovered shall be given to you
freely. The chests of gold that have been taken from
Gray Gables since the fire are all mine, you know, my
father's property, but the house belonged to that wicked
old man, and the property will bring you a good sum. I
am glad you will have this money, since you are too proud
to accept anything from me," Nita said gently.</p>

<p>The next day, Nita accompanied her friends to their
home in New York, taking with her Mrs. Hill and Lizette,
each of whom she presented with a sum of money
that, measured by their simple tastes, made them rich for
life.</p>

<p>"Miss Nita, you have made me so happy!" cried grateful
Lizette.</p>

<p>The girl was the sole support of her mother and a crippled
brother. The sick boy needed country air and food,
and would have died in the hot city but for the present
of money that Nita had given her the night she had saved
her from old Meg's murderous designs.</p>

<p>"With that money I sent them both into the country,
my mother and my brother, and it helped them, oh, so
much!" cried the maid. "To-morrow I shall seek them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
out, and now that I am rich, I can live with them and
take care of them so nicely, although I hate to leave your
service."</p>

<p>Nita sympathized with all the good girl's plans and
wishes, and lent her aid heartily to their accomplishment,
rejoicing in the great good she could accomplish out of
her store of wealth.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hill remained with her in spite of the fact that
she was now well-to-do.</p>

<p>"I love you too well to leave you, dear Miss Nita!"
cried the affectionate creature.</p>

<p>At Christmas, Nita and Dorian were married, and the
beauty of the bride and the splendor of the wedding at
the Van Hise mansion, on Fifth Avenue, created quite a
sensation.</p>

<p>Their wedding-tour was to Spain. Nita had a longing
to see her father's birth-place, and Donald Kayne, now her
devoted uncle and friend, shared her yearning.</p>

<p>He had a fancy to see Pepita's old home, so he accompanied
them, a welcome guest, on their journey.</p>


<p class="center">THE END.</p>


<p>The <span class="smcap">New Eagle Library</span> will next bring out a complicated
and entrancing romance, under the title of "The
Wiles of a Siren," by Effie Adelaide Rowlands, No. 1199.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Dealer" id="The_Dealer">The Dealer</a></h2>

<p>who handles the STREET &amp; SMITH NOVELS
is a man worth patronizing. The fact that he
does handle our books proves that he has considered
the merits of paper-covered lines, and
has decided that the STREET &amp; SMITH
NOVELS are superior to all others.</p>

<p>He has looked into the question of the morality
of the paper-covered book, for instance, and
feels that he is perfectly safe in handing one of
our novels to any one, because he has our assurance
that nothing except clean, wholesome
literature finds its way into our lines.</p>

<p>Therefore, the STREET &amp; SMITH NOVEL
dealer is a careful and wise tradesman, and it
is fair to assume selects the other articles he
has for sale with the same degree of intelligence
as he does his paper-covered books.</p>
